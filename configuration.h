 * Cut-down HDMI display builds
 * ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * HDMICUTDOWN marks the HDMI variants that use the reduced scanout pipeline:
 * the 96000-byte framebuffer pool (vs 153600), the limited resolution set,
 * the RGB332 R640x480x8 special mode, and the live (no-reboot) RESOLUTION
 * switch. Currently HDMIBTH and HDMIWEB. This is purely the *display* concern;
 * the BLE-HID-host concern stays gated separately on
 * (PICOMITEBTH || PICOMITEHDMIBTH) so HDMIWEB (WiFi, no Bluetooth) does not
 * drag in btstack.
 *
 * HDMICUTDOWN is defined via target_compile_definitions in CMakeLists.txt
 * (NOT here) so it is a global -D visible to every translation unit regardless
 * of include order — AllCommands.h, for one, is pulled in before this file.
