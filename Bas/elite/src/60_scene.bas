'  both of those belong to phase 3.  This is a hand-placed bubble that
'  exercises every part of the flight core: a rotating station near
'  enough to fill part of the view, ships at three different ranges,
'  something tumbling, and the planet close enough to show its curve
'  along the bottom of the screen.

' A brand new commander at Lave, with a hundred credits, three missiles
' and a pulse laser.  Everything the game needs to start is set here, so
' the test scene and a real new game begin from the same state.
