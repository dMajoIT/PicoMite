'  The equipment that does something drastic
'
'  An energy bomb kills everything in the bubble except the station, and
'  is gone once used.  An escape pod takes you home and leaves the ship,
'  its cargo and everything fitted to it behind - and clears your record,
'  because whoever they pull out of the capsule is somebody new.  The
'  in-system jump moves the whole bubble a unit closer, which is the
'  original's way of crossing the empty distance between a planet and its
'  sun without flying it; it refuses while anything but rocks and cargo is
'  about, inside the station's zone, in witchspace, or with the planet
'  close ahead.  And the galactic hyperdrive rotates the galaxy's seeds
'  one place, which is the whole of how the eight galaxies are made.
