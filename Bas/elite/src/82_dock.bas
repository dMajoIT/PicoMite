' =====================================================================
'  Docking, and what the station does about you
'
'  Docking is not a collision, it is five separate tests, and failing any
'  one of them at speed is fatal.
'
'    1  the station is not hostile
'    2  its own nose points back at us, within about 26 degrees
'    3  it is nearly dead ahead of us, within 22 degrees
'    4  and in front of us at all
'    5  the slot is within 33.6 degrees of horizontal
'
'  Test 5 is the one that makes docking a manoeuvre rather than an
'  approach, and it is worth being exact about what it means.  The slot is
'  a letterbox, 20 units across and 60 tall in the station's own frame, so
'  its long axis lies along the station's up vector.  The test measures the
'  x component of that up vector in OUR frame: when its magnitude is near
'  one, the slot's long axis is lying horizontally, which is the direction
'  our own ship is widest in.  So the ship has to be rolled to match the
'  station's rotation, with its wings along the long dimension of the port.
'  The station turns continuously, so that match has to be flown.
'
'  The original's own comment calls this 36.6 degrees; the arithmetic of
'  its threshold, 80 out of 96, is 33.6.
'
'  Below speed 5 a failed approach only bounces.  Above it, it does not.
