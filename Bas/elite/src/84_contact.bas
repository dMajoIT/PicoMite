'  Getting too close: altitude, heat, scooping and collisions
'
'  The original looks at the planet on frame 10 of every 32 and at the sun
'  on frame 20, which is why those two bars move in steps rather than
'  sliding.  Both work on the middle bytes of the coordinates and are
'  skipped entirely while anything is a whole unit away in any axis, so an
'  altitude bar reading full means no more than "further off than 65536".
'
'  Altitude.  q is the sum of the squares of the coordinates in high bytes,
'  divided by 256 again to keep it in a byte; the planet's own radius is 96
'  high bytes, which by the same arithmetic comes to 36.  One less than
'  that and you are inside the planet.  Above it the bar reads sixteen
'  times the square root, which is what the original's 16-bit square root
'  of the same figure comes to with its low byte left as it lay.
'
'  Cabin temperature is 285 less that same figure for the sun.  It starts
'  to climb around 65000 units out, reaches the scooping threshold of 224
'  at about 32000, and passes 255 - which is fatal - at about 22400.
'
'  Scooping needs fuel scoops fitted and the thing below us: you fly over
'  the top of a canister to take it in, which is the detail everybody
'  remembers.  Anything else that close is a collision.  A canister holds
'  anything from food to computers, an escape pod holds slaves, and a
'  Thargon counts as alien items.
