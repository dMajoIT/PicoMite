'  The galaxy
'
'  Elite does not store its universe; it generates it.  Three 16-bit
'  seeds are stirred by one short routine, and every system's name,
'  position, government, economy, technology, population, productivity
'  and radius falls out of particular bits of those seeds.  Eight
'  galaxies of 256 systems each come out of six bytes.
'
'  All of this has to be bit for bit identical to the original or the
'  universe is a different one, so nothing here is tidied up: the twist
'  is a 16-bit add with the carry thrown away, and every field is the
'  slice of bits the original took.  elite_tools/galaxy_ref.py is the
'  oracle, and tests/galaxy_test.bas checks the board against it.

' One turn of the generator: the third seed becomes the sum of all three,
' and the other two shuffle down.  Anything above 16 bits is discarded.
