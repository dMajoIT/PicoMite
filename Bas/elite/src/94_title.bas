'  The title screen, and the page that says what the keys do
'
'  The picture is a file rather than a drawing: elite_tools/titlescreen.py
'  renders the Cobra Mk III from the same blueprint the game flies, as a
'  hidden-line wireframe, and saves it as a JPEG.  Drawing it here would
'  cost a mesh and a pose for one screen that never moves.
'
'  If the file is missing the screen still works - it just draws the words
'  instead - so a copy of the program on its own is not broken by it.
'
'  Waiting here starts the demo, which is what an arcade cabinet does with
'  an idle machine; any key during the demo hands the controls back.
