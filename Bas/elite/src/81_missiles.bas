'  Missiles, E.C.M., cargo and consequences
'
'  A missile is a ship like any other, with its own blueprint and its own
'  place in the bubble.  What makes it a missile is that it runs its
'  tactics every single frame instead of one frame in eight, so it turns
'  faster than anything it chases, and that reaching its target destroys
'  them both.
'
'  It is stopped by one thing only: an E.C.M. burst destroys every missile
'  in the bubble, whoever fired it.  That is why a ship carrying E.C.M.
'  is so much harder to kill with missiles, and why firing one at a
'  Thargoid is usually a waste.
