' =====================================================================
'  Combat: lasers, damage, explosions, and what the other ships do
'
'  The laser does not travel.  Pressing fire tests whatever is lined up
'  in the crosshairs and hits it immediately, which is why Elite is about
'  pointing rather than leading a target.  The test is on the lateral
'  offset alone and does not consider range at all: a ship is hittable
'  when it is within 256 units of the line of sight in both axes and its
'  squared offset is inside the blueprint's targetable area.
'
'  Ships fight back on a schedule rather than every frame - one slot in
'  eight per frame - which is what keeps a busy bubble affordable and
'  gives the AI its slightly considered feel.
