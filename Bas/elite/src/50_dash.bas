' =====================================================================
'  The dashboard, the 3D scanner and the compass
'
'  Geometry taken from the original's screen addresses, converted with
'  x_ours = ROUND(x_bbc * 1.25) and y_ours = y_bbc - 16.  The BBC's
'  dashboard is character rows 24 to 30, i.e. BBC y 192..247, landing on
'  our rows 176..231; row 31 exists in memory but the video chip never
'  displays it, so our last eight rows have no counterpart and are free.
'
'  Note which column is which: speed, roll, dive/climb and the four
'  energy banks are on the RIGHT, and the six status bars on the LEFT.
'
'  Colour follows the original's threshold rule, which runs in opposite
'  directions for different indicators.  A high reading is dangerous for
'  speed and the two temperatures, so those turn red at the top of their
'  range; a low reading is dangerous for energy, shields and fuel, so
'  those turn red at the bottom.  Altitude never changes colour.
'
'  The whole screen is cleared each frame, because the planet's disc and
'  the outermost stardust reach below the space view and the drawing
'  primitives clip to the screen rather than to a region.  The fixed
'  artwork is therefore laid down again every frame, but by restoring a
'  photograph of it rather than by redrawing it.
' =====================================================================

' Drawn once, then read straight out of the framebuffer into an array.
' Every later call puts it back with one word-aligned memory copy of the
' 64 rows, a fraction of the cost of redrawing the labels and frames.
' fadd caches the write buffer's address, so this holds only while the
' framebuffer stays the write target - which it does for the whole game.
