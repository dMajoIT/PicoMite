'  E L I T E        PicoMite MMBasic, PicoComputer 3
'  after the 1984 BBC Micro game by Ian Bell and David Braben
'
'  Phase 2: the flight core.  Universe slots, player controls, ship
'  movement, the four views, ship / planet / sun / stardust rendering,
'  the dashboard and the 3D scanner.  No trading, no galaxy, no combat
'  yet - those are phases 3 and 4.
'
'  Geometry.  The BBC space view is 256 x 192 pixels centred on
'  (128, 96), with the dashboard in the bottom 64 rows of a 256 row
'  screen.  Ours is 320 x 176 centred on (160, 88) with the dashboard in
'  rows 176..239, and the projection keeps the BBC's focal length of 256
'  pixels, so every ship is exactly the size it was in 1984 and the
'  extra width is extra peripheral vision.
'
'  Ship meshes and statistics come straight out of the original 6502
'  source: Bas/elite_tools/blueprints.py turns the SHIP_* blueprints
'  into the DATA blocks at the end of this file.
'
'  Built by elite_tools/build.py from src/*.bas - do not edit elite.bas.
