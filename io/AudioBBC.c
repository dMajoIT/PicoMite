 */

 */
/*
 * The classic BBC Micro model: channels 1-3 are square-wave tones and
 * channel 0 is an LFSR noise source with the BBC's eight settings -
 * periodic or white, at three fixed rates or tuned to channel 1's tone.
 * Each channel has an 8-note queue;
 * the channel word's &1x bit flushes it and the &Sxx bits hold a note
 * until S other channels carry the same sync mark, which is how chords
 * start together.  ENVELOPE 1-16 gives the three-section pitch envelope
 * (auto-repeating, so vibrato, arpeggios and slides) and an ADSR
 * amplitude envelope, stepped at the authentic 100 Hz.  Pitch is the BBC
 * scale of 4 units per semitone with 89 = A4 = 440 Hz; durations are in
 * 20ths of a second and 255 means until further notice.
 *
 * This is a port of the Pico Computer 3's Fuzix sound engine (which also
 * carries a port of MMBasic's own PLAY SOUND synth, so the two have met
 * before).  The squares are band-limited with polyBLEP so a sustained
 * note holds a pure pitch at the top of the range instead of carrying the
 * aliasing shimmer a naive digital square picks up.
 *
 * Everything here is integer arithmetic, so it runs unchanged on the
 * RP2040.  The engine is one more filler for the audio swing buffers,
 * beside fillToneBuffer and fillSoundBuffer: fillBBCBuffer() writes
 * signed 16-bit stereo frames (both sides the same - the BBC was mono)
 * and Audio.c's iconvert/i2sconvert apply PLAY VOLUME and shape them for
 * the PWM, I2S or VS1053 output as they do for PLAY TONE.  It runs at
 * PWM_FREQ (44100), where PLAY TONE and PLAY SOUND run, so nothing in
 * the output stage changes with the source.
 *
 * Like PLAY TONE, the output is released when there is nothing left to
 * play: fillBBCBuffer sets playreadcomplete once every channel is idle
 * and every queue is empty, and audio_checks() then stops the audio.
 * The next PLAY BBC SOUND starts it again.
 *
 * RAM.  The engine's state - the four channels with their queues, the
 * sixteen envelopes, the noise generator - is one block of about 470
 * bytes taken from the MMBasic heap by the first PLAY BBC command a
 * program issues, so a program that never uses the engine pays nothing
 * for it.  The only permanent cost is the pointer.  The block outlives
 * the audio output: it is kept through the automatic stop and through
 * PLAY STOP, so envelope definitions survive them as they did on the
 * BBC, and it is released when the program's variables are - by
 * ClearRuntime, on RUN, NEW and program load - through BBCSoundRelease.
 * The engine is silenced and its queues flushed, envelopes kept, by
 * BBCSoundReset, which CloseAudio calls.
 *
 * Nothing here runs in an interrupt.  The filler is called from the
 * interpreter's idle loop (checkWAVinput), the same thread the commands
 * run in, so the queues need no locking, and the block is only ever
 * allocated from a command.
