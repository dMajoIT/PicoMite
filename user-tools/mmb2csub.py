"""mmb2csub.py - turn one MMBasic SUB into a PicoMite CSUB, in one command.

    python mmb2csub.py prog.bas --sub PlotJulia [-o out.txt] [--keep-c]

It drives the Fuzix MMBasic->C transpiler (mmb2c.py) to get C for the chosen
routine, wraps it in a CSUB entry shim, and runs armcfgen.py to produce the
`CSUB name ... End CSUB` block.

Why it is this small
--------------------
Two things do most of the work, and neither is in this file:

  * mmb2c already emits a SUB as `void f_name(MMFLOAT *p_a, MMINTEGER *p_b)` -
    one pointer per by-reference parameter, which IS the CSUB calling
    convention.  The shim below only has to cast the interpreter's void*.

  * mmcsub.h defines every runtime helper the generator may name (mm_*) and
    every arithmetic helper the compiler may emit (__aeabi_*), each forwarding
    to a firmware CallTable vector.  So anything unsupported is a COMPILE
    ERROR that names itself, and the scope check needs no hand-maintained list
    of supported statements.  A clean compile is the proof.

Scope (phase 1)
---------------
SUBs and numeric FUNCTIONs whose parameters are numeric scalars or numeric
arrays.  Everything else is refused here with a reason; everything subtly
unsupported is refused by the compiler.  Both refusals are better than a wrong
CSUB, which on a board is a hard fault with no line number.

FUNCTIONs need no special machinery, because MMBasic passes every argument by
reference: the CSUB takes the result as an extra leading out-parameter, the
generated C function is used exactly as mmb2c emitted it, and a three-line
BASIC wrapper keeps the original name so call sites do not change.
