# BLIT Command User Manual

## Overview

The BLIT commands provide fast block transfer of rectangular pixel regions. They are the primary mechanism for moving image data between buffers, loading images from files or flash, scaling, compositing layers, and drawing compressed or raw image data from memory.

### Buffer Identifiers

Several BLIT commands use single-letter buffer identifiers:

| Buffer | Name | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| `F` | Framebuffer | Primary off-screen buffer (created with `FRAMEBUFFER CREATE`) |
| `L` | Layer | Secondary overlay buffer (created with `FRAMEBUFFER LAYER`) |
| `N` | Display | Physical display buffer (VGA/HDMI only, requires RGB121 MODE 2/3) |
| `2` | Second FB | Second framebuffer (VGA/HDMI only) |
| `T` | Top Layer | Additional overlay (RP2350 VGA/HDMI only) |

---

## BLIT (bare)

Copies a rectangular region of pixels within the current write buffer.

### Syntax

```basic
BLIT x1, y1, x2, y2, w, h
```

### Parameters

| Parameter | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `x1`, `y1` | Source top-left coordinates |
| `x2`, `y2` | Destination top-left coordinates |
| `w` | Width in pixels (must be >= 1) |
| `h` | Height in pixels (must be >= 1) |

### Behaviour

- Copies from (x1, y1) to (x2, y2) within the current write buffer / display.
- Handles overlapping source and destination regions correctly.
- Coordinates are clipped to the screen bounds (HRes x VRes).
- Returns silently if w < 1, h < 1, or the region is fully off-screen.

### Example

```basic
' Copy a 64x64 region from (0,0) to (100,50)
BLIT 0, 0, 100, 50, 64, 64
```

---

## BLIT READ

Captures a rectangular region from the screen into a numbered blit buffer.

### Syntax

```basic
BLIT READ #n, x, y, w, h
```

### Parameters

| Parameter | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `#n` | Buffer number (1-64). The `#` prefix is optional. |
| `x`, `y` | Top-left corner of the screen region to capture |
| `w` | Width in pixels (must be >= 1) |
| `h` | Height in pixels (must be >= 1) |

### Behaviour

- Reads the screen region into the buffer as 24-bit RGB data.
- The buffer must not already be in use. Use `BLIT CLOSE` to free a buffer before reusing it.
- Negative coordinates are clipped. Returns silently if w < 1 or h < 1.

### Example

```basic
' Capture a 32x32 region from the screen
BLIT READ #1, 100, 50, 32, 32
```

---

## BLIT WRITE

Draws a previously-captured blit buffer to the screen.

### Syntax

```basic
BLIT WRITE #n, x, y [, mode]
```

### Parameters

| Parameter | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `#n` | Buffer number (1-64) |
| `x`, `y` | Destination top-left coordinates |
| `mode` | Optional mode flags (0-7, default 0) |

### Mode Flags

| Bit | Value | Effect |
|-----|-------|--------|
| 0 | 1 | Mirror horizontal |
| 1 | 2 | Mirror vertical |
| 2 | 4 | Transparent (black pixels are not drawn) |

Flags can be combined. For example, mode 5 = mirror horizontal + transparent.

### Behaviour

- Draws the buffer contents at the specified position.
- Supports horizontal/vertical mirroring and transparency.
- With transparency (mode bit 2), black pixels (RGB 0,0,0) are skipped, allowing the background to show through.
- Handles partial off-screen clipping.
- The buffer must have been previously filled with `BLIT READ` or `BLIT LOAD`.

### Example

```basic
BLIT READ #1, 0, 0, 32, 32         ' Capture
BLIT WRITE #1, 200, 100            ' Draw at new position
BLIT WRITE #1, 200, 100, 5         ' Draw mirrored horizontally + transparent
```

---

## BLIT CLOSE

Frees a blit buffer and releases its memory.

### Syntax

```basic
BLIT CLOSE #n
```

### Parameters

| Parameter | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `#n` | Buffer number (1-64) |

### Example

```basic
BLIT READ #1, 0, 0, 32, 32
' ... use the buffer ...
BLIT CLOSE #1                      ' Free the memory
```

---

## BLIT LOAD / BLIT LOADBMP

Loads a BMP image file (or a sub-region of it) into a blit buffer.

### Syntax

```basic
BLIT LOAD #n, filename$ [, x_offset, y_offset [, width, height]]
```

`BLIT LOADBMP` is accepted as an alternative spelling.

### Parameters

| Parameter | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `#n` | Buffer number (1-64) |
| `filename$` | Path to BMP file (`.bmp` extension auto-appended if missing) |
| `x_offset` | X origin within the BMP to start loading (default 0) |
| `y_offset` | Y origin within the BMP to start loading (default 0) |
| `width` | Width of sub-region to load (default: image width - x_offset) |
| `height` | Height of sub-region to load (default: image height - y_offset) |

### Behaviour

- Loads the BMP as 24-bit RGB data into the buffer.
- The buffer must not already be in use.
- Requires an SD card to be present.
- The sub-region specified by offset and dimensions must fit within the BMP image.

### Example

```basic
' Load an entire BMP
BLIT LOAD #1, "sprite.bmp"

' Load a 32x32 sub-region starting at (64, 0)
BLIT LOAD #2, "spritesheet.bmp", 64, 0, 32, 32

BLIT WRITE #1, 100, 50             ' Draw to screen
```

---

## BLIT MERGE

Composites a rectangular region of the Layer buffer on top of the Framebuffer with transparency, and copies the result to the physical LCD display. This is the partial-area equivalent of `FRAMEBUFFER MERGE`. Both commands apply only to LCD screens.

### Syntax

```basic
BLIT MERGE [colour], x, y, w, h [, mode [, timer]]
```

### Parameters

| Parameter | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `colour` | RGB121 colour index (0-15) treated as transparent during the merge (default 0) |
| `x`, `y` | Top-left corner of the region to merge |
| `w`, `h` | Width and height of the merge region |
| `mode` | Optional: `B` (background), `R` (repeating), `A` (abort) — SPI LCD builds only |
| `timer` | Repeat interval in milliseconds (0-600000, only with mode `R`) |

### Mode Options (SPI LCD Builds Only)

| Mode | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `B` | Run the merge once in the background (on core 1) |
| `R` | Run the merge repeatedly at the specified timer interval |
| `A` | Abort a running repeating merge |

### Behaviour

- Only available on LCD builds (not VGA or HDMI). `FRAMEBUFFER MERGE` provides the full-screen equivalent.
- Requires both a Framebuffer and a Layer to exist.
- For each pixel in the specified region: if the Layer pixel matches `colour`, the Framebuffer pixel is used; otherwise the Layer pixel is used.
- The composited result is sent directly to the physical LCD — neither the Framebuffer nor the Layer buffer is modified.
- The background and repeating modes allow the merge to run on core 1, freeing the main core for game logic.

**VGA/HDMI note:** On VGA and HDMI builds, BLIT MERGE and FRAMEBUFFER MERGE do not exist because layer compositing is performed automatically as part of the scanline output. The Layer buffer is composited on top of the display buffer every frame with no explicit command needed. On RP2350 in certain modes, a Top Layer (`T`) is also available, creating a three-layer composite: Top Layer over Layer over Display buffer.

### Example

```basic
' LCD display example
FRAMEBUFFER CREATE
FRAMEBUFFER LAYER

' Draw game world on framebuffer, HUD on layer
FRAMEBUFFER WRITE F
' ... draw world ...
FRAMEBUFFER WRITE L
CLS 0
TEXT 10, 10, "SCORE: 1000"

' Composite the HUD region onto the world and send to LCD
' (colour 0 = transparent, so only the text appears over the world)
BLIT MERGE 0, 0, 0, 320, 32
```

---

## BLIT RESIZE

Scales a rectangular source region into a destination rectangle using fast nearest-neighbour sampling. Operates on RGB121-packed buffers (4bpp).

### Syntax

```basic
BLIT RESIZE src, dst, sx, sy, sw, sh, dx, dy, dw, dh [, transparent]
```

### Parameters

| Parameter | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `src` | Source buffer: `L`, `F`, `N` (VGA/HDMI), `2` (VGA/HDMI), `T` (RP2350 VGA/HDMI) |
| `dst` | Destination buffer: `L`, `F`, `N` (VGA/HDMI), `2` (VGA/HDMI), `T` (RP2350 VGA/HDMI) |
| `sx`, `sy` | Top-left source coordinate |
| `sw`, `sh` | Source width and height (must be > 0) |
| `dx`, `dy` | Top-left destination coordinate |
| `dw`, `dh` | Destination width and height (must be > 0) |
| `transparent` | Optional RGB121 colour index to skip (0-15). Default -1 (disabled). |

### Behaviour

- Uses nearest-neighbour scaling (fast pixel replication/subsampling).
- Source rectangle validation is strict: must lie entirely within HRes x VRes.
- Destination rectangle is clipped to display bounds.
- If source and destination overlap in the same buffer, a temporary copy is automatically used.
- If `transparent` is 0-15, source pixels matching that colour are not written to the destination.
- If `src` or `dst` is `N`, the display must be in RGB121 mode (MODE 2 or MODE 3).

### Memory Use

- Non-overlap path: no temporary buffer allocated.
- Overlap path: temporary copy allocated as `((sw + 1) >> 1) * sh` bytes.

### Example

```basic
' Scale a 64x64 region from framebuffer to layer as 128x96
BLIT RESIZE F, L, 32, 16, 64, 64, 100, 40, 128, 96

' Scale with transparency: skip source pixel value 0
BLIT RESIZE F, L, 32, 16, 64, 64, 100, 40, 128, 96, 0
```

## BLIT FLASH

Copies a rectangular region from an image slot into a framebuffer. Images are loaded with `FLASH LOAD IMAGE`: slots 1-3 are flash and persist across power cycles, and on an RP2350 with PSRAM slots 4-8 are RAM slots 1-5 in PSRAM, which load faster and cost no flash wear but are cleared at every reset. Either kind renders without SD card access during gameplay.

### Syntax

```basic
BLIT FLASH slot, dst, x1, y1, x2, y2, w, h [, transparent]
```

### Parameters

| Parameter | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `slot` | Image slot number: 1-3 flash, 4-8 the RAM slots 1-5 (RP2350 with PSRAM only) |
| `dst` | Destination buffer: `L`, `F`, `N` (VGA only), `T` (RP2350 VGA only) |
| `x1`, `y1` | Top-left corner within the flash image (source region origin) |
| `x2`, `y2` | Top-left corner on the destination buffer |
| `w`, `h` | Width and height to copy |
| `transparent` | Optional RGB121 colour (0-15) to treat as transparent. Default -1 (disabled). |

### Behaviour

- The image must have been previously loaded with `FLASH LOAD IMAGE` into the same slot number.
- Images are stored in RGB121 format, in flash or in PSRAM.
- Source region must fit within the image dimensions.
- A RAM slot holds an image or a program, not both: `RAM SAVE` refuses a slot that holds an image, and `RAM ERASE` clears either.
- On non-VGA builds, `N` is not available as a destination.

### Example

```basic
' Load tileset into flash (one-time setup)
FLASH LOAD IMAGE 1, "background.bmp"

' During gameplay: blit from flash to framebuffer
BLIT FLASH 1, F, 0, 0, 0, 0, 320, 240

' Blit a 64x16 UI element with transparency
BLIT FLASH 2, F, 0, 0, 250, 5, 64, 16, 0

' The same from a RAM slot (RP2350 with PSRAM): slot 4 is RAM slot 1.
' RAM images are volatile, so load at every start.
FLASH LOAD IMAGE 4, "background.bmp", O
BLIT FLASH 4, F, 0, 0, 0, 0, 320, 240
```

---

## BLIT FRAMEBUFFER

Copies a rectangular region between framebuffers (Layer, Framebuffer, Display, Top Layer).

### Syntax

```basic
BLIT FRAMEBUFFER src, dst, x1, y1, x2, y2, w, h [, transparent]
```

### Parameters

| Parameter | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `src` | Source buffer: `L`, `F`, `N`, `T` (RP2350 VGA only) |
| `dst` | Destination buffer: `L`, `F`, `N`, `T` (RP2350 VGA only) |
| `x1`, `y1` | Source region top-left |
| `x2`, `y2` | Destination top-left |
| `w`, `h` | Width and height to copy |
| `transparent` | Optional RGB121 colour (0-15) to treat as transparent. Default -1 (disabled). |

### Behaviour

- Source and destination must be different buffers.
- When both buffers are in-memory, uses fast RGB121 nibble copy.
- On non-VGA builds with LCD displays, `N` reads from or writes to the physical LCD panel.
- Supports transparency: pixels matching the transparent colour are not written.

### Example

```basic
' Copy a region from framebuffer to layer
BLIT FRAMEBUFFER F, L, 0, 0, 0, 0, 320, 240

' Copy with transparency
BLIT FRAMEBUFFER L, F, 10, 10, 50, 50, 100, 80, 0
```

---

## BLIT COMPRESSED

Draws RLE-compressed 4-bit image data from a memory address to the screen.

### Syntax

```basic
BLIT COMPRESSED address, x, y [, transparent]
```

### Parameters

| Parameter | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `address` | Memory address of the compressed data |
| `x`, `y` | Destination top-left on screen |
| `transparent` | Optional RGB121 colour (0-15) to skip. Default -1 (disabled). |

### Behaviour

- The data at `address` starts with a 4-byte header: two `uint16_t` values for width and height.
- The image data following the header is RLE-compressed in 4-bit (nibble) format.
- Width must be <= HRes and height must be <= VRes.
- Typically used with data generated by CFunction tools or stored in program memory.

### Example

```basic
' Draw compressed image from a known memory address
BLIT COMPRESSED PEEK(CFUNADDR img_data), 50, 30
```

---

## BLIT MEMORY

Draws uncompressed (or auto-detected compressed) 4-bit image data from a memory address.

### Syntax

```basic
BLIT MEMORY address, x, y [, transparent]
```

### Parameters

| Parameter | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `address` | Memory address of the image data |
| `x`, `y` | Destination top-left on screen |
| `transparent` | Optional RGB121 colour (0-15) to skip. Default -1 (disabled). |

### Behaviour

- The data starts with a 4-byte header: two `uint16_t` values for width and height.
- If the high bit (0x8000) of either dimension is set, the data is treated as RLE-compressed and decompressed automatically. The lower 15 bits give the actual dimensions.
- For uncompressed data, pixels are stored as packed 4-bit nibbles (2 pixels per byte).
- Supports transparency: pixels matching the transparent colour are not drawn.
- Uses optimised byte-level copy when alignment permits (x even, w even, no transparency).

### Example

```basic
' Draw nibble-packed image data from memory
BLIT MEMORY img_addr%, 0, 0

' Draw with transparency (colour 0 = transparent)
BLIT MEMORY img_addr%, 100, 50, 0
```
