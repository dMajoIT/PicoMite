# Writing Games in PicoMite MMBasic — A Developer's Guide

## Introduction

PicoMite MMBasic is a remarkably capable platform for writing games, offering a suite of firmware-accelerated subsystems purpose-built for game development. Whether you want to create a side-scrolling platformer, a Wolfenstein-style 3D shooter, a sprite-based arcade game, or a rotating-cube puzzle, MMBasic provides the building blocks — all accessible from BASIC with no C coding required.

This guide provides an overview of the game development facilities, explains how they fit together, and offers practical guidance on structuring a game. For full command reference details, see the dedicated manuals:

## Choosing Your Display Mode

The first decision is your display output and resolution. This determines available colours, performance, and which subsystems you can use.

### VGA / HDMI Output

| Mode | Resolution | Colours | Best For |
|------|-----------|---------|----------|
| MODE 1 | 640×480 | 2 (per tile, 16 palette) | Text-heavy games, retro style |
| MODE 2 | 320×240 | 16 (RGB121) | **Recommended for most games** |
| MODE 3 | 640×480 | 16 (RGB121) | Higher-res sprite games |
| MODE 4 | 800×600 | 2 | Large monochrome games |
| MODE 5 | 1024×768 | 2 | Large monochrome games |

**MODE 2 (320×240, 16 colours)** is the sweet spot for game development. It provides a full 16-colour RGB121 palette, fast framebuffer operations, and is the recommended mode for the TILEMAP and RAY engines.

On RP2350 hardware, additional VGA222 modes offer 64 colours at various resolutions.

### SPI LCD Panels

Supported panels include ILI9341 (320×240), ST7789 (240×240 or 320×240), ST7796 (480×320), ILI9488 (480×320), and many more. On RP2350, buffered SPI variants (e.g., ST7796SPBUFF, ILI9341BUFF) support full framebuffer compositing, making them viable for game development.

### The RGB121 Palette

Most game subsystems (TILEMAP, RAY, BLIT operations) work with the 4-bit RGB121 palette:

| Index | Colour | Index | Colour |
|-------|--------|-------|--------|
| 0 | BLACK | 8 | RED |
| 1 | BLUE | 9 | MAGENTA |
| 2 | MYRTLE | 10 | RUST |
| 3 | COBALT | 11 | FUCHSIA |
| 4 | MIDGREEN | 12 | BROWN |
| 5 | CERULEAN | 13 | LILAC |
| 6 | GREEN | 14 | YELLOW |
| 7 | CYAN | 15 | WHITE |

### Recolouring Without Redrawing - the MAP Command

Those sixteen slots are not fixed colours: they are *indexes*. What each one
looks like is decided by the display at scanout, from a sixteen-entry colour
map. Change the map and everything already on the screen in that slot changes
colour - with no redraw, and no per-frame cost at all.

That makes it the cheapest animation on the machine. A pulsing crystal, a
throbbing force field, a warning lamp, water shifting between shades, a power-up
that glints: draw the object once in a reserved slot, then just move the map.

```basic
CONST GLOW = 10                    ' a slot nothing else in the artwork uses
DIM INTEGER glow(5), phase
glow(0) = RGB(0,0,96)    : glow(1) = RGB(0,64,160)  : glow(2) = RGB(0,128,224)
glow(3) = RGB(96,192,255): glow(4) = RGB(0,128,224) : glow(5) = RGB(0,64,160)

' ... draw the crystal once, using colour GLOW ...

DO
  phase = (phase + 1) MOD 6
  MAP(GLOW) = glow(phase)
  MAP SET                          ' commits every pending change at once
  ' ... the rest of the frame ...
LOOP
```

`MAP SET` is what makes staged changes live, so several slots can be moved and
committed together. `MAP RESET` puts the standard sixteen back.

Four things to know before relying on it:

**Reserve the slot.** The map is global. Recolour a slot your hero's sprite also
uses and your hero changes colour too. Decide early which slots are "effect"
slots and keep the artwork out of them.

**`MAP(i)` does not read back the colour.** As a function it returns the RGB
value that *selects* slot `i`, not the colour that slot is currently showing.
Nothing can ask the display what a slot looks like, so keep your own copy if you
need to know.

**The map survives RUN.** It is display state, not program state. A game that
leaves a slot recoloured finds it still recoloured next run - and so does the
next program the user starts. `MAP RESET : MAP SET` during start-up, and again
on the way out, saves a great deal of confusion.

**Firmware before 6.03.02b8 ignores the map in `SAVE IMAGE`.** Screenshots come
out in the default palette, so a map effect cannot be checked from a saved BMP
on older firmware - look at the screen.

## The Framebuffer — Your Rendering Canvas

Almost all game rendering in MMBasic uses double buffering via the FRAMEBUFFER system. The pattern is simple: draw everything to an off-screen buffer, then copy the finished frame to the display in one operation. This eliminates flicker and tearing.

### Setting Up

```basic
MODE 2                    ' 320x240, 16 colours
CLS
FRAMEBUFFER CREATE        ' Allocate off-screen buffer (F)
FRAMEBUFFER WRITE F       ' Direct all drawing to the framebuffer
```

### The Core Game Loop Pattern

```basic
DO
  FRAMEBUFFER WRITE F     ' Draw to framebuffer
  CLS RGB(BLACK)          ' Clear the frame

  ' --- All your rendering goes here ---
  ' Draw background, tilemap, sprites, HUD, etc.

  FRAMEBUFFER COPY F, N   ' Flip: copy framebuffer to display
  
  ' --- Input and game logic ---
  k$ = INKEY$
  ' Process input, update positions, check collisions...

LOOP UNTIL done%
FRAMEBUFFER CLOSE
```

### Do not hand the flip to the other core

`FRAMEBUFFER COPY F, N` has a third form, `FRAMEBUFFER COPY F, N, B`, which
gives the copy to core 1 and returns immediately. It looks like free
performance and in a game loop it is a trap, because the very next thing the
loop does is `CLS` the buffer that is still being copied. On a display fast
enough you get away with it; on a slower one the screen is shown a frame being
blanked underneath it, which reads as flashing that comes and goes with how
much you are drawing - and looks for all the world like a tearing or
double-buffering problem rather than what it is.

Use the plain two-argument form in the loop. If you want the background copy,
you must not touch that buffer until the copy has finished, which in practice
means having something else to draw into. Note also that the form is only
honoured by some display types and is silently a no-op on the rest, so it can
appear to work for months on the machine you develop on.


### Layer Compositing

The framebuffer system supports multiple buffers for compositing:

| Buffer | Name | Purpose |
|--------|------|---------|
| **N** | Display | The physical screen |
| **F** | Framebuffer | Primary off-screen buffer |
| **L** | Layer | Secondary overlay buffer |
| **T** | Top Layer | Additional overlay (RP2350 VGA/HDMI) |
| **2** | Second FB | Second framebuffer (VGA/HDMI) |

Use `FRAMEBUFFER LAYER` to create the layer buffer for overlaying HUD elements, particle effects, or other transparent overlays on top of the game world. How the layer is composited onto the display depends on your output type — this is a key difference between LCD and VGA/HDMI builds.

### LCD Displays: Explicit MERGE

On LCD builds (SPI or parallel panels), layer compositing is performed explicitly using `FRAMEBUFFER MERGE` or `BLIT MERGE`. These commands take the Layer buffer, overlay it on top of the Framebuffer with a transparency colour, and send the composited result directly to the physical LCD. Neither the Layer nor the Framebuffer is modified — only the LCD receives the merged output.

```basic
' LCD layer compositing
FRAMEBUFFER CREATE
FRAMEBUFFER LAYER
FRAMEBUFFER WRITE F
' ... draw game world on framebuffer ...
FRAMEBUFFER WRITE L
CLS 0                         ' Clear layer, colour 0 = transparent
TEXT 10, 10, "SCORE: 1000"    ' Draw HUD on layer
FRAMEBUFFER MERGE 0           ' Composite layer over framebuffer, send to LCD
```

Use `BLIT MERGE` to composite only a sub-rectangle (e.g., just the HUD area) for better performance. Background and repeating modes let the merge run on core 1, freeing the main core for game logic.

### VGA / HDMI Displays: Automatic Layer Compositing

On VGA and HDMI builds, `FRAMEBUFFER MERGE` and `BLIT MERGE` **do not exist**. Instead, layer compositing happens automatically as part of the scanline output — the hardware renders the Layer buffer on top of the display buffer every frame with no explicit command needed.

Simply draw to the Layer buffer and the compositing is handled for you:

```basic
' VGA/HDMI layer compositing (automatic)
FRAMEBUFFER CREATE
FRAMEBUFFER LAYER
FRAMEBUFFER WRITE L
CLS 0                         ' Clear layer, colour 0 = transparent
TEXT 10, 10, "SCORE: 1000"    ' Draw HUD on layer
FRAMEBUFFER WRITE F
' ... draw game world on framebuffer ...
FRAMEBUFFER COPY F, N         ' Copy framebuffer to display — layer is composited automatically
```

On RP2350 VGA/HDMI in certain modes (MODE 2, 3, 5), a **Top Layer** (`T`) is also available via `FRAMEBUFFER LAYER TOP`, creating a three-layer composite with this priority order:

1. **Top Layer (T)** — highest priority (checked first)
2. **Layer (L)** — middle priority
3. **Display (N)** — base layer (shown where the layers above are transparent)

Each layer has its own transparency colour. This allows separating different overlay elements — for example, the Layer for in-game particle effects and the Top Layer for a fixed HUD.

### Writing Portable Code

Two more things differ between machines, and both are cheap to allow for.

**`MODE` may not exist.** A VGA or HDMI build has modes; an SPI panel has one
fixed resolution and the command is an error there, which stops your program on
its second line. Ask for the mode you want and let it fail:

```basic
ON ERROR SKIP 1
MODE 2
ON ERROR CLEAR
```

Whatever the display already is, is what you then draw on.

**The screen may be taller than the area you draw.** If you have written for
320x240 and the panel is 320x320, everything still works - but `FRAMEBUFFER
CREATE` takes `HRES * VRES / 2` bytes, so you are paying for eighty rows you
never use. `POKE DISPLAY VRES n` changes MMBasic's own idea of the height, with
nothing written to flash, and must come **before** `FRAMEBUFFER CREATE`:

```basic
DIM INTEGER realVres
realVres = MM.VRES
IF realVres > 240 THEN POKE DISPLAY VRES 240
FRAMEBUFFER CREATE
```

On the 320x320 panel that is 12 KB of heap back - which, as the next section
explains, is the difference between a game that runs and one that does not. Put
the height back on the way out, on every exit path, and be aware that `OPTION
DISPLAY VRES` is a *different* command that is refused outright when the panel
is the console.


If your game needs to run on both LCD and VGA/HDMI hardware, structure the rendering so that the layer compositing step can differ:

```basic
FRAMEBUFFER CREATE
FRAMEBUFFER LAYER

DO
  FRAMEBUFFER WRITE F
  ' ... draw game world ...
  FRAMEBUFFER WRITE L
  CLS 0
  ' ... draw HUD/overlays ...

  ' For LCD: composite and send to display
  ' FRAMEBUFFER MERGE 0

  ' For VGA/HDMI: just copy framebuffer, layer composites automatically
  FRAMEBUFFER COPY F, N
LOOP
```

## Approach 1: Sprite-Based Games

The SPRITE engine is ideal for **arcade-style games** with individual moving objects — shooters, platformers, Pong, Breakout, top-down RPGs, and similar. It provides hardware-accelerated sprite management with automatic collision detection.

### Key Capabilities

- **Up to 64 sprites** (numbered 1–64)
- **5 layers** (0–4) for z-ordering
- **Automatic collision detection**: sprite-to-sprite, sprite-to-edge, sprite-to-static-object
- **Background preservation**: sprites save and restore the background beneath them
- **Rotation and mirroring** (8 orientations)
- **Batch movement** via SPRITE NEXT / SPRITE MOVE
- **Background scrolling** with wrap-around (SPRITE SCROLL)

### Loading Sprites

Sprites can be loaded from several sources:

```basic
' From a .spr text file (compact, easy to edit)
SPRITE LOAD "player.spr", 1

' From a BMP image
SPRITE LOADBMP #1, "hero.bmp"

' From a PNG with alpha (RP2350 only)
SPRITE LOADPNG #1, "hero.png"

' From an array (procedurally generated)
DIM INTEGER pixels%(255)
' ... fill array ...
SPRITE LOADARRAY #1, 16, 16, pixels%()

' Capture from screen
SPRITE READ #5, 100, 100, 32, 32
```

**Sprite file format (.spr):** A simple text format where the first line defines `width, count [, height]` and each sprite is defined row-by-row using hex colour characters (0–9, A–F). Spaces are transparent. Lines starting with `'` are comments.

### Creating Copies

If you need multiple instances of the same sprite (e.g., a swarm of enemies), use SPRITE COPY to share image data efficiently:

```basic
SPRITE LOAD "enemy.spr", 1        ' Load the template
SPRITE COPY #1, #2, 9             ' Create 9 copies: sprites #2 through #10
```

### Displaying and Moving

```basic
' Show a sprite at position (100, 50) on layer 1
SPRITE SHOW #1, 100, 50, 1

' Move it (simple approach)
SPRITE SHOW #1, 110, 50, 1        ' Redraws at new position

' Move with overlap safety (slower but correct when sprites overlap)
SPRITE SHOW SAFE #1, 110, 50, 1

' Batch movement (most efficient for multiple sprites)
SPRITE NEXT #1, 110, 50
SPRITE NEXT #2, 200, 100
SPRITE NEXT #3, 50, 150
SPRITE MOVE                        ' All three move simultaneously
```

### Animation via Sprite Swapping

The most efficient animation technique is SPRITE SWAP — load multiple animation frames into separate buffers, then swap between them:

```basic
SPRITE LOAD "walk.spr", 1         ' Loads multiple frames into buffers 1, 2, 3, 4
SPRITE SHOW #1, 100, 100, 1       ' Display frame 1

' In game loop:
frame% = (frame% MOD 4) + 1
SPRITE SWAP #displayed%, #frame%   ' Swap to next animation frame
```

### Collision Detection

The sprite engine provides three types of collision detection:

**1. Sprite-to-Sprite Collisions**
```basic
SPRITE INTERRUPT collision_handler

' In the interrupt handler:
collision_handler:
  who% = SPRITE(S)                    ' Which sprite triggered it?
  count% = SPRITE(C, #who%)           ' How many collisions?
  FOR i% = 1 TO count%
    other% = SPRITE(C, #who%, i%)     ' What did it hit?
    IF other% < &h80 THEN
      PRINT "Hit sprite"; other%
    ENDIF
  NEXT i%
  IRETURN
```

**2. Screen Edge Collisions**
```basic
edges% = SPRITE(E, #1)
IF edges% AND 1 THEN PRINT "Hit left edge"
IF edges% AND 4 THEN PRINT "Hit right edge"
```

**3. Static Object Collisions** — invisible rectangular trigger zones:
```basic
' Define walls and platforms
SPRITE STATIC #1, 0, 0, 320, 10        ' Top wall
SPRITE STATIC #2, 0, 230, 320, 10      ' Bottom wall
SPRITE STINTERRUPT wall_hit

wall_hit:
  spr% = SPRITE(ST, COLLISION)          ' Which sprite hit?
  obj% = SPRITE(ST, OBJECT)             ' Which static object?
  IRETURN
```

**4. Background Pixel Collision** — tests sprite pixels against the background:
```basic
result% = SPRITE(B, #1)
IF result% = 2 THEN
  ' Pixel-level collision with background
  push_left% = SPRITE(B, #1, 4)        ' Penetration from left
  push_right% = SPRITE(B, #1, 5)       ' Penetration from right
ENDIF
```

### Utility Functions

```basic
SPRITE(X, #n)       ' X position (-10000 if not displayed)
SPRITE(Y, #n)       ' Y position
SPRITE(W, #n)       ' Width in pixels
SPRITE(H, #n)       ' Height in pixels
SPRITE(L, #n)       ' Layer (-1 if not displayed)
SPRITE(D, #n1, #n2) ' Distance between two sprites
SPRITE(V, #n1, #n2) ' Angle from sprite #n1 to #n2 (radians)
SPRITE(N)            ' Number of displayed sprites
```

### Background Scrolling

For side-scrolling games, SPRITE SCROLL moves the background and all layer-0 sprites together:

```basic
SPRITE SCROLL 2, 0, -2    ' Scroll right by 2 pixels, wrap-around
' Layer 0 sprites scroll with background
' Layers 1-4 remain fixed (good for HUD elements)
```

---

## Approach 2: Tile Map Games

The TILEMAP engine (RP2350 only) is designed for **2D scrolling worlds** — platformers, top-down adventure games, puzzle games, and anything with a tile-based world. It provides hardware-accelerated rendering of large maps with sub-tile smooth scrolling.

### Why Use TILEMAP?

Drawing a 320×240 viewport with 16×16 tiles requires rendering ~336 tiles per frame. Doing this from BASIC with individual BLIT calls would be far too slow. TILEMAP DRAW does it all in a single C-level call with automatic viewport clipping and sub-tile scrolling.

### Setting Up a Tile Map

**Step 1: Prepare a tileset image** — a BMP with all tiles arranged in a grid (e.g., 256×64 pixels = 64 tiles of 16×16):

```basic
FLASH LOAD IMAGE 1, "tileset.bmp"
```

**Step 2: Define the map in DATA statements:**

```basic
TILEMAP CREATE mapdata, 1, 1, 16, 16, 16, 20, 15
' Parameters: label, slot, flash_slot, tileW, tileH, tiles_per_row, cols, rows
END

mapdata:
DATA 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
DATA 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
' ... more rows ...
DATA 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1
```

Tile index 0 is always empty (transparent). Indices 1+ reference tiles from the tileset image.

**Step 3: Define tile attributes** for collision:

```basic
CONST SOLID = &b0001
CONST LADDER = &b0010
CONST DAMAGE = &b0100
CONST COLLECT = &b1000

TILEMAP ATTR attrdata, 1, 6
END

attrdata:
DATA 0            ' Tile 1: passable
DATA SOLID        ' Tile 2: solid brick
DATA SOLID        ' Tile 3: solid stone
DATA LADDER       ' Tile 4: ladder
DATA COLLECT      ' Tile 5: coin
DATA DAMAGE       ' Tile 6: spikes
```

### Rendering the Map

```basic
' Draw the visible viewport
TILEMAP DRAW 1, F, camX, camY, 0, 0, 320, 240

' With transparency (for overlay layers)
TILEMAP DRAW 1, F, camX, camY, 0, 0, 320, 240, 0
```

The viewport coordinates (`camX`, `camY`) provide pixel-precise smooth scrolling. Partially visible tiles at edges are automatically clipped.

### Camera Control

```basic
' Follow the player
camX = playerX - 160
camY = playerY - 120

' Or use built-in scroll with clamping
TILEMAP SCROLL 1, 2, 0       ' Scroll right 2 pixels (auto-clamps to bounds)
camX = TILEMAP(VIEWX 1)
camY = TILEMAP(VIEWY 1)

' Or set absolute position
TILEMAP VIEW 1, playerX - 160, playerY - 120
```

### Tile-Based Collision Detection

The TILEMAP engine includes attribute-based collision — define what each tile *type* means (solid, ladder, collectible, etc.) and test rectangular regions against the map:

```basic
' Movement with solid-tile blocking
CONST SOLID = &b0001
newX% = px% + speed%
IF TILEMAP(COLLISION 1, newX%, py%, 14, 22, SOLID) = 0 THEN
  px% = newX%        ' No solid obstacle — allow movement
ENDIF

' Gravity with landing detection
newY% = py% + velY%
IF TILEMAP(COLLISION 1, px%, newY%, 14, 22, SOLID) = 0 THEN
  py% = newY%        ' Falling
ELSE
  velY% = 0          ' Landed
  py% = (newY% \ 16) * 16 - 22   ' Snap to tile boundary
ENDIF

' Collectible pickup
t% = TILEMAP(TILE 1, px% + 8, py% + 12)
IF t% > 0 AND (TILEMAP(ATTR 1, t%) AND COLLECT) THEN
  TILEMAP SET 1, (px% + 8) \ 16, (py% + 12) \ 16, 0   ' Remove coin
  score% = score% + 100
ENDIF
```

### TILEMAP Sprites

The TILEMAP system includes its own lightweight sprite layer for game entities. These sprites reference tiles from the tilemap's tileset and are rendered in batch for performance:

```basic
' Create player sprite using tile 7 from tilemap 1's tileset
TILEMAP SPRITE CREATE 1, 1, 7, 160, 120

' Move it
TILEMAP SPRITE MOVE 1, playerX%, playerY%

' Animate by changing tiles
IF frame% MOD 10 < 5 THEN
  TILEMAP SPRITE SET 1, 7     ' Walk frame A
ELSE
  TILEMAP SPRITE SET 1, 8     ' Walk frame B
ENDIF

' Draw all sprites in one call
TILEMAP SPRITE DRAW F, 0      ' F = framebuffer, 0 = transparent colour

' Check sprite-sprite collision
IF TILEMAP(SPRITE HIT 1, 2) THEN PRINT "Player hit enemy!"
```

### Parallax Scrolling

Use multiple tilemaps with different scroll rates for a parallax effect:

```basic
FLASH LOAD IMAGE 1, "bg_tiles.bmp"
FLASH LOAD IMAGE 2, "fg_tiles.bmp"

TILEMAP CREATE bgdata, 1, 1, 16, 16, 8, 50, 15    ' Background
TILEMAP CREATE fgdata, 2, 2, 16, 16, 16, 100, 15   ' Foreground

' In game loop:
TILEMAP DRAW 1, F, camX\2, camY\2, 0, 0, 320, 240          ' BG at half speed
TILEMAP DRAW 2, F, camX, camY, 0, 0, 320, 240, 0            ' FG with transparency
TILEMAP SPRITE DRAW F, 0                                      ' Sprites on top
```

### Dynamic Maps

Modify the map at runtime for interactive elements:

```basic
TILEMAP SET 1, col%, row%, 0       ' Remove a tile (e.g., collected coin)
TILEMAP SET 1, col%, row%, 3       ' Place a tile (e.g., close a door)
```

### Memory Efficiency

Map data is stored internally as `uint16_t` (2 bytes per cell), far more efficient than using BASIC integer arrays (8 bytes each). A 200×30 map uses only 12 KB.

## Approach 3: First-Person 3D (Raycaster)

The RAY engine (RP2350 only) provides a **Wolfenstein 3D-style first-person renderer** with textured walls, patterned floors/ceilings, billboard sprites, sliding doors, and built-in collision detection.

### Quick Start

```basic
MODE 2
CLS

DIM m$(3) LENGTH 4
m$(0) = "1111"
m$(1) = "1001"
m$(2) = "1001"
m$(3) = "1111"

FRAMEBUFFER CREATE
FRAMEBUFFER WRITE F

RAY MAP 4, 4, m$()
RAY CAMERA 2.5, 2.5, 0, 66
RAY COLOUR 12, 3, 8, 1, 1, 3    ' Floor/ceiling colours and patterns

DO
  RAY RENDER                      ' Render the 3D scene
  FRAMEBUFFER COPY F, N           ' Display
  k$ = INKEY$
  IF k$ = "w" THEN RAY MOVE 0.1
  IF k$ = "s" THEN RAY MOVE -0.1
  IF k$ = "a" THEN RAY TURN -5
  IF k$ = "d" THEN RAY TURN 5
LOOP UNTIL k$ = CHR$(27)

RAY CLOSE
FRAMEBUFFER CLOSE
```

### Map Definition

Maps use a grid where each cell is either empty (0) or a wall type (1–31). The string-array format uses just 1 byte per cell:

```basic
DIM m$(50) LENGTH 57
m$(0) = "111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111"
m$(1) = "100000000000000000000000000001000000000000000000000000001"
' ... etc ...
```

Characters `0`=empty, `1`–`9`=wall types 1–9, `A`–`Z`=wall types 10–35.

### Wall Customisation

Each wall type has configurable appearance using fill patterns:

```basic
RAY DEFINE 1, 8, 10, 3        ' Type 1: red/rust, pattern 3
RAY DEFINE 2, 6, 4, 5         ' Type 2: green/midgreen, pattern 5
RAY DEFINE 7, 1, 3, 6, 1      ' Type 7: blue door (door flag=1)
```

### Movement with Collision

`RAY MOVE` handles collision detection automatically — the player slides along walls:

```basic
RAY MOVE 0.15                  ' Move forward
RAY MOVE -0.15                 ' Move backward
RAY MOVE 0.15, 0.1             ' Forward + strafe right
RAY TURN 5                     ' Rotate 5° clockwise
```

### Sliding Doors

Up to 8 doors can animate simultaneously:

```basic
' Animate opening over multiple frames
door_offset! = 0.0
DO WHILE door_offset! < 1.0
  door_offset! = door_offset! + 0.1
  RAY DOOR door_x%, door_y%, door_offset!
  RAY RENDER
  FRAMEBUFFER COPY F, N
  PAUSE 50
LOOP
```

### Billboard Sprites

Place 2D sprites in the 3D world — they always face the camera and are depth-sorted automatically:

```basic
SPRITE LOADARRAY 1, 16, 16, enemy_img%()   ' Load sprite image
RAY SPRITE 0, 1, 5.5, 3.5                   ' Place at world position

' Move a sprite
RAY SPRITE 0, 1, newX!, newY!

' Remove
RAY SPRITE REMOVE 0
```

### Ray Casting for Interaction

Cast a single ray to detect what the player is looking at — useful for "use" buttons, shooting, or proximity checks:

```basic
RAY CAST RAY(CAMA)             ' Cast in camera direction
IF RAY(CASTDIST) < 2.0 THEN
  wall_type% = RAY(CASTWALL)
  cell_x% = RAY(CASTX)
  cell_y% = RAY(CASTY)
  ' Handle interaction...
ENDIF
```

### Minimap Overlay

```basic
RAY RENDER
RAY MINIMAP 2, 2, 48           ' Draw minimap at (2,2), 48px wide
FRAMEBUFFER COPY F, N
```

---

## Approach 4: 3D Object Graphics

The DRAW3D system provides **quaternion-based 3D rendering** for displaying and rotating solid objects — useful for 3D puzzle games, object viewers, rotating logos, or in-game 3D elements.

### Key Features

- Up to 8 objects, 3 cameras
- Quaternion rotation (no gimbal lock)
- Depth-sorted face rendering
- Surface normal hidden-face removal
- Configurable lighting with ambient levels
- Per-face colour, edge colour, and fill colour

### Creating a 3D Object

Objects are defined by vertices, faces, and colours:

```basic
DIM vertex(7, 2) AS FLOAT       ' 8 vertices × 3 coordinates
DIM facecount(5) AS INTEGER     ' 6 faces (cube)
DIM faces(23) AS INTEGER        ' 6 faces × 4 vertices each
DIM colours(6) AS INTEGER       ' Colour palette
DIM linecolour(5) AS INTEGER    ' Edge colour per face
DIM fillcolour(5) AS INTEGER    ' Fill colour per face

' ... fill arrays with vertex/face data ...

3D CAMERA 1, 400                ' Set up camera (viewplane distance = 400)
3D CREATE 1, 8, 6, 1, vertex(), facecount(), faces(), colours(), linecolour(), fillcolour()
```

### Rotation with Quaternions

```basic
DIM quat(4) AS FLOAT
angle! = RAD(10)
quat(0) = COS(angle!/2)         ' w
quat(1) = 0                     ' x
quat(2) = SIN(angle!/2)         ' y (rotate around Y axis)
quat(3) = 0                     ' z
quat(4) = 1                     ' magnitude

3D RESET 1                      ' Reset to original orientation
3D ROTATE quat(), 1             ' Apply rotation
3D SHOW 1, 0, 0, 200            ' Display at (0, 0, z=200)
```

### Lighting

```basic
3D LIGHT 1, -100, 100, -50, 30  ' Light position + 30% ambient
3D SET FLAGS 1, 8, 0, 6         ' Enable lighting on all 6 faces
```

---

## Drawing Primitives

MMBasic provides a complete set of drawing primitives that are essential for backgrounds, HUD elements, particle effects, and any custom rendering.

### Available Primitives

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `PIXEL x, y, colour` | Set/read individual pixels |
| `LINE (x1,y1)-(x2,y2), colour, width` | Lines with variable width |
| `BOX x, y, w, h, linewidth, colour, fill` | Rectangles |
| `RBOX x, y, w, h, radius, colour, fill` | Rounded rectangles |
| `CIRCLE x, y, r, linewidth, colour, fill` | Circles and ellipses |
| `ARC x, y, r, start, end, colour` | Arcs and wedges |
| `TRIANGLE x0,y0,x1,y1,x2,y2, colour, fill` | Triangles |
| `POLYGON n, x(), y(), colour, fill` | N-sided polygons |
| `BEZIER x0,y0,x1,y1,x2,y2,x3,y3, colour` | Bezier curves |
| `FILL x, y, colour` | Flood fill |
| `TEXT x, y, str$, just, font, scale, fc, bc` | Render text |
| `CLS colour` | Clear screen/buffer |

### Using Primitives for Game Graphics

**Health bar:**
```basic
BOX 10, 5, 100, 10, 1, RGB(WHITE), RGB(BLACK)      ' Border
BOX 11, 6, health%, 8, 0, RGB(RED), RGB(RED)        ' Fill
```

**Particle effects:**
```basic
FOR i% = 0 TO num_particles%
  PIXEL px%(i%), py%(i%), RGB(YELLOW)
  py%(i%) = py%(i%) + vy%(i%)
  vy%(i%) = vy%(i%) + 1                              ' Gravity
NEXT i%
```

**Radar/minimap:**
```basic
CIRCLE radar_x%, radar_y%, 30, 1, RGB(GREEN)
FOR i% = 0 TO num_enemies%
  dx% = enemy_x%(i%) - player_x%
  dy% = enemy_y%(i%) - player_y%
  PIXEL radar_x% + dx%/scale%, radar_y% + dy%/scale%, RGB(RED)
NEXT i%
```

## BLIT Operations — Fast Image Transfer

The BLIT commands provide fast block transfer of rectangular pixel regions between buffers. These are the workhorses for custom rendering pipelines.

### Key BLIT Commands

| Command | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `BLIT FLASH slot, dst, sx, sy, dx, dy, w, h [, trans]` | Draw from flash image to buffer |
| `BLIT FRAMEBUFFER src, dst, x1, y1, x2, y2, w, h [, trans]` | Copy between F/L/N/T buffers |
| `BLIT RESIZE src, dst, sx, sy, sw, sh, dx, dy, dw, dh [, trans]` | Scale/resize between buffers |
| `BLIT MERGE trans, x, y, w, h` | Partial-area layer merge |
| `BLIT LOAD #n, "file.bmp"` | Load BMP into blit buffer |

### FLASH-Based Image System

For games that need to draw background images, tile-like elements, or UI graphics without an SD card at runtime, load BMPs into flash once and blit from flash during gameplay:

```basic
' One-time setup (load assets into flash)
FLASH LOAD IMAGE 1, "background.bmp"
FLASH LOAD IMAGE 2, "ui_elements.bmp"

' During gameplay — blit from flash to framebuffer
BLIT FLASH 1, F, 0, 0, 0, 0, 320, 240              ' Full background
BLIT FLASH 2, F, 0, 0, 250, 5, 64, 16, 0           ' UI element with transparency
```

### Installing Assets Once - and Knowing They Are Yours

`FLASH LOAD IMAGE` erases and rewrites a whole flash slot. That takes a
noticeable moment and wears the flash, so a game that does it on every run pays
for it every run. Write the slot once, then check it.

The check is built in: **without `OVERWRITE`, `FLASH LOAD IMAGE` refuses with
"Already programmed" when the slot is in use.** A skipped error is therefore the
program asking "has this already been done?":

```basic
SUB InstallImage(slot, file$)
  LOCAL e$
  ON ERROR CLEAR                  ' so a stale error cannot be mistaken for ours
  ON ERROR SKIP 1
  FLASH LOAD IMAGE slot, file$
  e$ = MM.ERRMSG$
  ON ERROR CLEAR
  IF e$ <> "" AND INSTR(e$, "Already programmed") = 0 THEN ERROR e$
END SUB
```

That answers "is something in the slot?" but not "is it *mine*?", and the
difference matters more than it sounds. The user may have another game's images
in those slots, and your own artwork changes between versions. Loading the wrong
sheet does not crash - it draws a plausible-looking picture made of the wrong
squares, which is a far more baffling bug report than a crash would be.

A flash image begins with its own dimensions, so start there:

```basic
LOCAL a
a = MM.INFO(FLASH ADDRESS slot)
IF PEEK(WORD a) <> wantW OR PEEK(WORD a + 4) <> wantH THEN
  ERROR "FLASH ERASE " + STR$(slot) + ", then run again"
ENDIF
```

**But the same size does not mean the same picture.** If a new version of your
artwork renumbers the tiles without changing the sheet's dimensions, the size
check passes and the map cheerfully indexes the old tiles. To catch that,
compare a few words of the picture itself. What `FLASH LOAD IMAGE` stores is
exactly determined by the BMP, so a build script can work out what those words
must be and emit them as `DATA`:

| Offset | Contents |
|--------|----------|
| 0 | image width, 32-bit |
| 4 | image height, 32-bit |
| 8 onward | the picture, **top row first**, `width / 2` bytes per row |

Each byte holds two pixels with the **left one in the low nibble**. The nibble
is the RGB121 code - red bit 7, green bits 7 and 6, blue bit 7 of the colour -
which is *not* the BMP's own palette index, so a build script must put the BMP
palette through the same conversion. Sample words from several places in the
image, and skip any that come out blank: a run of zeroes matches any other
image's blank run and proves nothing.

Note the ordering. BMPs store their rows bottom-up, but the flash image is
written top row first, so the *last* row in the file is the *first* in flash.

### Scaling with BLIT RESIZE

```basic
' Scale a 64x64 region up to 128x96
BLIT RESIZE F, L, 32, 16, 64, 64, 100, 40, 128, 96

' Scale with transparency
BLIT RESIZE F, L, 32, 16, 64, 64, 100, 40, 128, 96, 0
```

---

## Input Handling

Games need responsive input. MMBasic offers several options depending on your hardware.

### Keyboard Input

**INKEY$** — simple single-key polling:
```basic
k$ = INKEY$
IF k$ = "w" THEN move_forward
IF k$ = CHR$(27) THEN quit
```

**KEYDOWN** — simultaneous key detection (up to 7 keys):
```basic
IF KEYDOWN(128) THEN move_up       ' Up arrow
IF KEYDOWN(129) THEN move_down     ' Down arrow
IF KEYDOWN(130) THEN move_left     ' Left arrow
IF KEYDOWN(131) THEN move_right    ' Right arrow
IF KEYDOWN(32) THEN fire           ' Space
n% = KEYDOWN(0)                    ' Number of keys currently pressed
```

**Press versus hold.** `KEYDOWN` reports what is held *now*, so
`IF KEYDOWN(32) THEN Fire` fires on every frame the key is down. For actions
that should happen once per press - jump, a single shot, opening a door,
changing weapon - remember what was held last frame and require a release
first:

```basic
DIM INTEGER kNow(255), kWas(255)

SUB ReadKeys
  LOCAL INTEGER i, n
  FOR i = 0 TO 255 : kWas(i) = kNow(i) : kNow(i) = 0 : NEXT i
  n = KEYDOWN(0)
  FOR i = 1 TO n : kNow(KEYDOWN(i)) = 1 : NEXT i
END SUB

FUNCTION Held(k)    : Held = kNow(k) : END FUNCTION
FUNCTION Pressed(k) : Pressed = kNow(k) AND kWas(k) = 0 : END FUNCTION
```

Call `ReadKeys` once at the top of the frame - never twice, or the second call
overwrites the previous state and `Pressed()` never fires. Then use `Held()` for
movement and thrust, `Pressed()` for everything else. Keep the whole key set in
one array and the two behaviours stay one line apart rather than scattered
through the game.

**Do not mix `INKEY$` and `KEYDOWN` for the same key.** `INKEY$` takes a
keypress out of the console buffer; `KEYDOWN` reports the physical state of the
keyboard. Consuming a key with `INKEY$` does *not* stop `KEYDOWN` reporting it
as still down until it is physically released, so a game that reads both will
act on the same press twice. Pick one and use it throughout.

**Testing note:** writing key codes to the console over a serial link does not
drive a `KEYDOWN` loop - a `KEYDOWN` call clears pending console input as a side
effect. A game built on `KEYDOWN` can only be driven from a real keyboard, so
plan another way to test it automatically.

### USB Gamepad (USB Keyboard Builds)

' Available waveforms: Sine, sQuare, Triangle, saWtooth, Noise, Pink, User, Off
```

### The BBC Micro's SOUND and ENVELOPE

`PLAY BBC SOUND` and `PLAY BBC ENVELOPE` are the BBC Micro's own statements,
with the same parameters and the same units. They are worth knowing even if the
BBC means nothing to you, because what they give you is a **four-channel
sequencer**: a note is queued with a duration and plays in its turn, so a tune
is a run of statements rather than a timing problem your game loop has to solve.

```basic
PLAY BBC ENVELOPE 1, 1, 0,0,0, 0,0,0, 126, -50, 0, 0, 100, 0
PLAY BBC SOUND &H13, 1, 100, 1      ' channel 3, flushed, envelope 1, 1/20 s
```

- `channel` is a word, not a number: the low nibble picks channel 0-3, `&10`
  flushes whatever that channel already has queued, `&100`/`&200`/`&300` hold
  notes back so several channels start together.
- `amplitude` is `-15` to `0` for a plain volume, or `1` to `16` to select an
  envelope, which then shapes the volume and can bend the pitch as it plays.
- `pitch` is in quarter semitones, 89 being the A above middle C.
- `duration` is in twentieths of a second, or `255` for "until something
  flushes it".

Three things to plan around:

**Each channel queues eight notes, and a ninth statement waits.** That is what
paces a tune for free - a loop of `PLAY BBC SOUND` statements runs at the speed
of the music with no timing code at all. It also means a sixteen-note jingle
fired from inside your game loop stops the game dead halfway through. Keep a
burst under eight notes, or split it around whatever else has to happen.

**Channel 0 is the noise generator, and its pitch 3 and 7 are clocked by
channel 1.** A noise effect that wants a sweep gets it by playing a tone on
channel 1 at the same time, which means channel 1 is not free for music while
that effect is sounding.

**Flushing is how effects retrigger, and how they cut each other off.** An
engine noise that reasserts itself every frame on a flushed channel will also
silence an explosion started on that channel a moment earlier - the explosion
never gets past its first frame. Decide which channel each class of effect owns,
and if two must share, gate the quieter one.

### Playing Audio Files

```basic
PLAY WAV "explosion.wav"
PLAY FLAC "music.flac"
PLAY MP3 "bgmusic.mp3"
PLAY MODFILE "chiptune.mod"        ' Amiga MOD tracker files!
```

### MOD Files and Sound Effects with PLAY MODSAMPLE

Amiga MOD tracker files are an excellent choice for game background music — they are compact, loop naturally, and have an authentic retro sound. MMBasic plays them via `PLAY MODFILE`, which uses 4 tracker channels to mix the music in real time.

The key advantage for game developers is `PLAY MODSAMPLE`, which lets you trigger individual samples *from the loaded MOD file* as one-shot sound effects **while the music continues playing**. MOD files contain up to 32 embedded instrument samples (explosions, bleeps, thuds, etc.), and you can play any of them on demand over the top of the background music using up to 4 dedicated sound-effect channels.

**Syntax:**
```basic
PLAY MODSAMPLE sample_number, channel [, volume]
```

| Parameter | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `sample_number` | Sample number within the MOD file (1–32) |
| `channel` | Sound effect channel (1–4) |
| `volume` | Optional playback volume (0–64, default 63) |

This means you can design your MOD file to serve double duty: the tracker patterns provide background music, while unused or dedicated samples in the same file provide your entire sound-effect library. No additional WAV files, no extra memory, no audio channel conflicts.

**Practical example — background music with sound effects:**
```basic
' Start the background music
PLAY MODFILE "game.mod"

' Later, during gameplay:
PLAY MODSAMPLE 5, 1            ' Trigger sample 5 (e.g., laser) on effect channel 1
PLAY MODSAMPLE 8, 2, 40        ' Trigger sample 8 (e.g., coin) on channel 2 at volume 40
PLAY MODSAMPLE 12, 3           ' Trigger sample 12 (e.g., explosion) on channel 3
```

**Tips for using MODSAMPLE in games:**
- Compose your MOD file in a tracker (e.g., OpenMPT, MilkyTracker) with samples designated for sound effects — put them in higher sample slots (e.g., 17–32) so they are easy to identify
- Use different effect channels for different sound categories (e.g., channel 1 for weapons, channel 2 for pickups, channel 3 for UI) so that rapid-fire sounds replace only their own category
- The sound effects mix with the MOD music automatically — no additional code for mixing is needed
- If you trigger a new sample on a channel that is already playing an effect, the new sample replaces the previous one on that channel

### Wavetable Synthesis with ADSR (RP2350)

For sophisticated sound effects, PLAY SAMPLE provides a wavetable synthesizer with per-channel ADSR envelopes:

```basic
' Define a sine waveform
CONST N = 256
DIM INTEGER wave%(N - 1)
FOR i% = 0 TO N - 1
  wave%(i%) = INT(SIN(2 * PI * i% / N) * 32000)
NEXT i%

' Play with ADSR envelope (attack=50ms, decay=100ms, sustain=60%, release=200ms)
PLAY SAMPLE wave%(), wave%(), 440, 50, 100, 60, 200

' Trigger release (note fades out)
PLAY RELEASE
```

### Volume Control

```basic
PLAY VOLUME 80, 80                 ' Left, right (0-100)
PLAY PAUSE                         ' Pause audio
PLAY RESUME                        ' Resume audio
```

---

## Text UI with FRAME

The FRAME system provides a character-cell based panel system for HUDs, menus, inventories, and dialogue boxes. It works on both VGA displays and serial terminals.

```basic
FRAME CREATE
FRAME BOX 0, 0, 40, 3             ' Create a panel
FRAME TITLE 1, "STATUS"
FRAME PRINT 1, "HP: 100  MP: 50  Gold: 1234"
FRAME WRITE                        ' Render to screen
```

FRAME is especially useful for text-adventure style games, RPG interfaces, or overlaying text HUDs on graphical games.

## Structuring a Game

### Game Architecture Pattern

Most MMBasic games follow a common structure:

```basic

CONST SCREEN_W = 320
CONST SCREEN_H = 240

' ===== Initialisation =====
MODE 2

### Performance Tips

1. **Use MODE 2 (320×240)** — half the pixels of MODE 3, twice the speed
2. **Use FRAMEBUFFER** — always double-buffer to avoid flicker
3. **Use SPRITE NEXT/MOVE** — batch sprite movements are faster than individual SHOW calls
4. **Pre-load assets into flash** — `FLASH LOAD IMAGE` eliminates SD card access during gameplay
5. **Minimise BASIC loops** — use firmware-accelerated commands (TILEMAP DRAW, RAY RENDER, SPRITE MOVE) instead of per-pixel BASIC code
6. **Use integer variables** where possible — suffix with `%` for faster maths
7. **Use OPTION EXPLICIT** — catches typos and forces variable declaration
8. **Use string maps for RAY** — 1 byte per cell vs 8 bytes for integer arrays
9. **Use SPRITE COPY** — shared image data saves memory when you need many identical sprites
10. **Use tile attributes** — one TILEMAP(COLLISION ..., mask) call replaces dozens of individual tile checks
11. **Separate the simulation tick from the draw** - run the game's logic at a
    fixed rate and draw whatever the clock allows, rather than letting the
    physics run as fast as the frame does. A game whose speed depends on how
    much is on screen is very hard to tune, and impossible to reproduce a bug
    in. Time the two halves separately: knowing that a slow frame is 0.3 ms of
    logic and 6.8 ms of drawing tells you immediately which one to attack.
12. **Move the hot loop into a CSUB when interpretation dominates.** Above a
    certain amount of per-object work, the cost is the interpreter reading
    statements, not the arithmetic in them - and no amount of tightening the
    BASIC helps. Rewriting one inner loop in C can be a hundredfold: a
    per-object physics update measured at 9.8 ms in BASIC ran in 0.28 ms as a
    CSUB doing exactly the same arithmetic. Keep the CSUB's state in an integer
    array shared with the BASIC so nothing has to be copied across the boundary
    each call.

### The trace cache

`OPTION TRACECACHE ON n` compiles the assignments and `IF` conditions it sees
into a form it can replay, which is worth having in a game because a game is a
handful of statements executed hundreds of times a frame. Three things about it
are not obvious and each one cost a measurement to learn.

**The size rounds up to a power of two.** `ON 100` and `ON 80` are the same 128
slots; only 128 and 256 differ in that range. A carefully chosen number between
them changes nothing at all, which is an easy afternoon to lose.

**Aim it.** `OPTION CACHE SUB DrawStars, DrawScanner` restricts caching to the
subs you name, so the slots go to the loops that run every frame instead of
being spent on start-up code that runs once. `OPTION CACHE DEBUG ON` then prints
every statement that would not compile, which is how you find out that the inner
loop you were counting on is built round a call to one of your own
`FUNCTION`s - the cache cannot compile those, and the statement stays
interpreted however many slots you give it.

**It comes out of the same heap as everything else,** at roughly 216 bytes a
slot: 128 slots is about 27 KB and 256 about 54 KB. It is also taken *lazily*,
at the first statement that wants a slot, which is long after your start-up code
has worked out how much room it has for other things.

So the size is a machine-dependent decision, not a constant. Ask at run time:

```basic
IF MM.INFO(PSRAM SIZE) > 0 THEN
  OPTION TRACECACHE ON 256
ELSE
  OPTION TRACECACHE ON 128
ENDIF
```

Measured on one game over an identical 300-frame run, going from 128 to 256
slots on a machine with PSRAM took the cache misses from 18,618 to 757 and the
frame from 41.9 ms to 37.7 ms - about a tenth, for nothing but a number. 512
slots took the misses to zero and the frame to 37.1 ms, which was not worth
another 54 KB. `OPTION PROFILING ON` reports all of those counters at `END`; see
`option-profiling-cache.pdf` for the full reference.


### Memory Considerations

PicoMite has limited RAM. Budget carefully:

| Resource | Typical Size |
|----------|-------------|
| Framebuffer (320×240×4bpp) | ~38 KB |
| Layer buffer | ~38 KB |
| Tilemap (200×30) | 12 KB |
| Sprite buffer (32×32) | ~512 bytes |
| 64 sprites (32×32 each) | ~32 KB |
| Raycaster state | ~6.5 KB |
| Flash images | Stored in flash, not RAM |

Use `FLASH LOAD IMAGE` to keep large images in flash rather than RAM. Use SPRITE COPY for multiple instances of the same sprite. Use string-array maps for the raycaster.

### Living within the heap

Everything above competes for one pool, and several of the biggest consumers are
invisible in your source: the framebuffer, the trace cache, each `DRAW3D`
object, the audio buffers. `MM.INFO(HEAP)` reports what is free and `MEMORY`
breaks it down. Three habits make the difference between a game that fits and
one that dies unpredictably.

**Claim fixed-size buffers at start up, not on first use.** A `STATIC` array
inside a SUB is allocated the first time that SUB runs, which for a dashboard or
a scratch buffer is somewhere in the middle of the first level - by which time
the title screen's image has been and gone and the world is full of objects.
The same array declared globally is claimed when the heap is empty and can never
fail. It is the same memory either way; only the moment differs, and the late
moment is the one that fails.

**Never find a limit by running into it.** The obvious way to discover how many
objects you can afford is to create them until one fails and count. Do not:
taking the heap to nothing takes the interpreter with it, and the error then
surfaces from whatever statement runs *next* rather than from the allocation, so
the `ON ERROR SKIP` you carefully put on the allocation never sees it. What you
get is `Not enough System Heap memory` reported against an innocent line.

Price one unit instead and do the arithmetic, keeping a reserve back for
everything still to come:

```basic
h0 = MM.INFO(HEAP)
Draw3D CREATE 1, nv, nf, 1, v(), fc(), f(), col(), ec()
cost = h0 - MM.INFO(HEAP)
Draw3D CLOSE 1
maxObj = (h0 - HEAPRESERVE) \ cost
```

The reserve is doing real work, not being timid: in the game this comes from,
three objects at 4 KB each still left an in-flight floor of only 7.6 KB, so a
fourth would have left 3.5 KB and a fifth none.

**Let the allocation fail softly anyway.** However good the sum, the moment an
object is actually wanted is not the moment you measured, so guard the real
call: if it fails, do without that object this frame - draw the ship as a dash
on the scanner rather than a mesh - and bring the cap down to what the machine
really has. The player sees slightly less detail; the alternative is the program
stopping.

**A heap error names the allocation that asked, not the one at fault.** This is
worth internalising because it will mislead you for hours. The pool is shared,
so whichever allocation happens to ask when it is empty is the one reported -
and it is usually an innocent bystander. In one case a 10 KB dashboard buffer
was blamed three times running; the real fault was an object pool
over-committed ten to one, and the buffer was simply the next thing to ask.
**If you suspect an allocation, move it to start up and see where the failure
goes.** If it moves, the thing you suspected was innocent.

## Choosing the Right Approach

| Game Type | Recommended Engine |
|-----------|-------------------|
| Arcade shooter | SPRITE engine |
| Pong / Breakout | SPRITE engine + drawing primitives |
| Side-scrolling platformer | TILEMAP + TILEMAP SPRITE |
| Top-down RPG / adventure | TILEMAP + TILEMAP SPRITE |
| Wolfenstein / Doom-like FPS | RAY engine |
| 3D puzzle / object viewer | 3D graphics system |
| Text adventure / RPG menus | FRAME system |
| Board games / card games | Drawing primitives + BLIT |
| Rhythm game | PLAY SAMPLE + drawing primitives |

### Combining Systems

These systems can be combined. For example:

- **TILEMAP + FRAME**: A platformer with a text-based inventory overlay
- **RAY + SPRITE**: A first-person game with billboard sprites for enemies and items
- **3D + drawing primitives**: A rotating 3D object with 2D HUD overlays
- **TILEMAP + PLAY SOUND**: A platformer with multi-channel sound effects
- **Any game + PLAY MODFILE**: Background chiptune music from MOD files

## Porting an Existing Game

If you are bringing a game across from another machine rather than inventing
one, the hardest part is not the graphics - it is knowing whether your version
behaves like the original. A few habits make that tractable.

**Get a reference you can run.** A disassembly you read is not the same as an
implementation you can execute. If you can run the original - in an emulator, or
in a small interpreter for its CPU - you can put it side by side with your port
and compare, which turns "does this feel right?" into a question with an answer.

**Drive both sides with the same randomness.** Record every random number the
original draws, keyed by where it drew it, and feed those numbers to your port
at the matching places. Otherwise the two diverge immediately for reasons that
have nothing to do with your code being wrong.

**Compare all the state, not just the obvious part.** The temptation is to
compare the things you already think about - the objects, the player. Everything
else drifts in silence, and the bug surfaces hours later somewhere unrelated. In
this project the object table was compared for weeks while a single timer
elsewhere was never decremented, which meant no door in the game could open; the
scenes that covered doors all passed. Widening the comparison to the whole of
the shared state found that in one run, and three more bugs with it.

**Prove that each check can fail.** A comparison that has never failed may be
watching nothing at all. Deliberately reintroduce a bug you have fixed and
confirm the harness catches it, and where. This is the cheapest test you will
ever write and it repeatedly finds checks that were quietly disabled.

**Reaching the code is not exercising it.** Coverage tells you a routine ran,
not that it did anything. Three scenes reached the door-handling routine every
time and all passed, while no door was capable of opening.

**Where exactness is impossible, measure the gap instead of hiding it.** Some
original behaviour depends on things your port does not have - reading pixels
back from the screen, for instance, or exact timing. Do not quietly let those
cases pass. Count how often they agree, report the number, and write down why it
cannot be 100%, so that a change making it worse is visible rather than
invisible.

**The notes are not the code.** A good disassembly comes with prose explaining
what its author worked out, and that prose is the most useful thing in the
repository - and it is not authoritative. In one of these ports the notes said
the game ran at 50 frames a second, in four separate places. The code did not:
the routine *named* for waiting on the vertical sync actually spins on the
centisecond clock until it reads 3, so the frame is 30 ms and the game runs at
33.3 Hz. Every rate in the game - rotation, gravity, the periodic force update,
the countdown - was derived from that one tick, so believing the notes made the
port 1.5x too fast in every axis at once.

That class of error is invisible, which is what makes it expensive. Nothing
looks wrong. No single behaviour is identifiably off, because they are all off
by the same factor and stay in proportion to one another. What it feels like
from outside is that the game is unreasonably hard, which is exactly how the
first tester described it. **If a port feels unfairly difficult and you cannot
point at anything specific, suspect the frame rate before you suspect your
physics.**

**Find the frame before you write anything else.** Locate the routine the
original loops on, work out from the instructions how long it really waits, and
derive every rate in your port from that number. In the same port the notes gave
the rotation as "about 8.4 steps per second"; the code is a three-frames-in-four
test, which at the real rate is 25 steps a second. You cannot get that figure at
all until you know what a frame is.

**Behaviour that reads as a bug is usually faithful.** You will find things that
look obviously broken: a game that starts you with an empty tank, a refuelling
test that only succeeds from one side, a pickup that requires you to move *away*
from the thing you are collecting, a shield that burns fuel and protects you
from nothing. Every one of those was in the original, and every one is part of
how the game plays. Check the code before you "fix" anything. And when you keep
a rule that surprises people, **say so in the game** - leaving without the cargo
silently costs a life in the original, and a two-word warning in the status
panel turned that from a stream of bug reports into a mechanic.

**Transcribing a table proves nothing about the code that reads it.** The sound
in one port was audited by decoding every sound and envelope block out of the
original binary and diffing it against what the port emitted. All of them
matched byte for byte - and eight call sites were still wrong, because the
blocks were only primitives. The original played almost none of them directly:
it wrapped them in named routines, and every piece of behaviour lived in the
wrappers. One of them muted the engine for a fixed number of frames after an
explosion, and without it a player who was thrusting when they died cut their
own explosion off after a single frame. **Audit the callers, not just the
constants.**

**A transcribed test still needs its inputs checked.** That same audit missed a
bug a player found in the first minute: the walking sound played continuously
whether or not the character was moving. The test itself was a faithful
transcription - "did he move?" - and what was wrong was the flag feeding it,
which eight places in the update set for their own reasons, one of them firing
every frame while he stood still on solid ground. Comparing our code against the
original could never have found it, because the line that was wrong had no
counterpart in the original at all. When you transcribe a condition, check that
the values it tests are derived the way the original derives them - and prefer
to **measure state rather than flag it**. "His position changed since last
frame" cannot be set by accident in a branch that was thinking about something
else.

**Generate the source.** These ports are a few thousand lines of MMBasic each,
and most of that is `DATA`: level maps, sprite bitmaps, terrain runs, sound
blocks, physics tables. None of it was typed. A short Python script per
subsystem reads the original binary and prints the `DATA` statements, and a
`build.py` splices them into the hand-written code and writes the finished
`.bas`. When you discover the level format was wrong you re-run the generator
instead of re-keying three hundred lines, and the generator is where you write
down what you learned about the format.

One rule that costs an afternoon to learn: **have the build write straight to
the file you actually load.** A build that lands in the tools directory beside
the generator is a build nobody runs, and when the game on the board stubbornly
fails to change you will look for the fault in your code long before you look
for it in the path.

## Shipping a Finished Game

A game that only runs from the root of `A:` is awkward to hand to anyone else.
Two firmware features let it live in a folder on any drive and start with a
single `RUN`.

### Finding your own assets

`MM.INFO(PATH)` is the directory the running program was loaded from. Use it for
every asset path and the game works wherever it is installed:

```basic
DIM home$
home$ = MM.INFO(PATH)
IF home$ = "NONE" THEN home$ = "A:/"
OPEN home$ + "level1.dat" FOR INPUT AS #1
```

The path comes from a `'#filename` header the loader writes as the program's
first line, so it is only available to a program **loaded from a file**. One
that arrived over `AUTOSAVE` has no header and `MM.INFO(PATH)` returns `"NONE"`,
which is why the fallback is worth keeping while developing.

### Code too big for program memory

Program memory is split into two halves of the same size - the program and the
library - and a large game can outgrow the program half on its own, with no CSUB
involved. The library is not only for code: **every `CONST`, `DIM` and `DATA`
block you move into it costs the program nothing**, because the library's top
level runs before your first line and its declarations are simply there when you
start. A game whose declarations and generated tables ran to 33 KB moved all of
them and bought back the whole of that from the program half.

That splits the build as well as the program, so let a script do it: keep the
declarations in their own source file, have `build.py` emit both halves, and
have it check that what it puts in the library is only declarations. The one
rule to enforce is that nothing game-specific can go in
the library that another program would choke on, because a library runs in front
of *every* program on the machine, not just yours.


A large CSUB costs its hex text as well as its compiled code and can easily
exceed program memory. Put it in the library instead - and have the program
install its own, rather than relying on the user having run `LIBRARY SAVE`:

```basic
LIBRARY LOAD MM.INFO(PATH) + "mygame_lib.bas"
OPTION EXPLICIT
' ... the rest of the program ...
```

Three rules come with it:

- **It must be the program's first statement.** The library's own top level runs
  before your program's first line, so one loaded later would arrive too late to
  be initialised. Comment lines ahead of it are fine, including the `'#filename`
  header the loader added.
- **It is idempotent.** The hash of the source is kept in the options, so a
  program doing this on every run reads the file, finds the library already
  matches, and touches no flash at all. Only a *different* library costs
  anything.
- **It restarts the program.** A library cannot be initialised mid-run, so when
  one is written execution begins again at line 1 - where the command is now a
  no-op. Your program sees a clean start, not a resumed one, so do not put
  anything before it that should happen once.

Do not add `OVERWRITE` in a released game. Without it the board asks before
replacing a library that may belong to something the user cares about, and the
question only appears when the library actually differs - so an ordinary run is
silent anyway.

### One RUN from nothing

Put that together with the flash-slot install above and the whole thing is
automatic: the library writes itself and restarts, the flash slots fill if they
are empty and are verified if they are not, and everything else loads from
`home$`. The user copies one folder and types one command. The first run takes a
minute; every run after that starts in a second.

Ship a plain-text README in the same folder. It is the only documentation most
players will ever see, and it is the right place for the keys, the install
command, and what to include in a bug report.

---

## MMBasic Traps Worth Knowing

A few that are easy to hit and hard to diagnose:

**The board remembers its last error.** When a game dies while you are not
watching the console - which is most of the time, because the console is usually
the screen the game is using - the information is still there at the prompt
afterwards:

```basic
PRINT MM.ERRNO          ' the number
PRINT MM.ERRMSG$        ' the text
PRINT MM.ERRLINE        ' the line, 1-based
PRINT MM.INFO(CURRENT)  ' which file it was
```

Those are cleared by `RUN` and by `ON ERROR CLEAR`, and by nothing else - not by
`PRINT`, not by Ctrl-C. So a crash stays diagnosable long after the fact, and
reading them is almost always quicker than reproducing the fault. Read them
*first*, before you try anything that might run the program again and wipe them.
The line number maps onto the built `.bas` if your build strips comments, which
is another reason to have the build write the file you actually load.


**`RESTORE` to a label, always.** An unqualified `READ` takes the program's
*first* `DATA` statement, wherever that happens to be. Add a generated `DATA`
block ahead of an existing one and the old `READ` silently starts consuming the
new numbers - which surfaces as a nonsense error a long way from the cause.

```basic
RESTORE LevelData
FOR i = 1 TO n : READ tile(i) : NEXT i
LevelData:
DATA 1, 2, 3, 4
```

**`TEXT` with a background colour only erases its own width.** Printing a
shorter string over a longer one leaves the tail of the old one behind. Pad to a
fixed width, or clear the area first.

**Work out how many characters actually fit.** Font 7 is 6 pixels wide, font 1
is 8. A 64-pixel status panel holds ten characters of font 7 and no more, so
`"SCORE 1000"` fits and `"SCORE 10000"` does not - and the overflow is silent.
Count before designing a panel, and leave headroom for the largest value a field
can reach, not the value it shows at the start.

**Names are unique irrespective of type suffix, and case does not separate
them either.** `k` and `k$` are the same name, and so are `FIREGAP` and
`fireGap` - which collides with the natural habit of naming a constant after the
variable it initialises. `CONST FIREGAP = 12` followed by a variable `fireGap`
is a redeclaration, not a pair. Give the constant a different word, not a
different case. A no-argument built-in function name cannot be used as a
variable at all.

**A SUB cannot be named after a command.** `SUB Play` looks perfectly
reasonable and then fails at every call site with "Unknown command", because
`PLAY` is parsed as the statement it is. The same goes for any other keyword.

**Poking at a running game from the console has two sharp edges.** A program's
`CONST`, `DIM` and `OPTION EXPLICIT` are *statements*: none of those names exist
until the program has executed them. Call one of its SUBs from the prompt before
any `RUN` and it runs with every constant reading as an undeclared zero, and
without `OPTION EXPLICIT` there to object - so the call succeeds and quietly
tests something other than what you meant. Start the program, let it reach its
title screen and break out of it first. After that: variables cannot be invented
at the prompt, the command line truncates around 250 characters, a `FOR` and its
`NEXT` cannot span two entries, and `MM.ERRNO` is cleared only by a `RUN`, so a
stale value from a typo three commands ago will sit there through every later
test. Breaking out with Ctrl-C while a SUB is executing leaves that SUB's locals
declared, which makes the next call behave differently from the first.
