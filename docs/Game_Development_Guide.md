# Writing Games in PicoMite MMBasic — A Developer's Guide

## Introduction

PicoMite MMBasic is a remarkably capable platform for writing games, offering a suite of firmware-accelerated subsystems purpose-built for game development. Whether you want to create a side-scrolling platformer, a Wolfenstein-style 3D shooter, a sprite-based arcade game, or a rotating-cube puzzle, MMBasic provides the building blocks — all accessible from BASIC with no C coding required.

This guide provides an overview of the game development facilities, explains how they fit together, and offers practical guidance on structuring a game. For full command reference details, see the dedicated manuals:

## Choosing Your Display Mode

The first decision is your display output and resolution. This determines available colours, performance, and which subsystems you can use.

### VGA / HDMI Output

| Mode | Resolution | Colours | Best For |
|------|-----------|---------|----------|
| MODE 1 | 640×480 | 2 (per tile, 16 palette) | Text-heavy games, retro style |
| MODE 2 | 320×240 | 16 (RGB121) | **Recommended for most games** |
| MODE 3 | 640×480 | 16 (RGB121) | Higher-res sprite games |
| MODE 4 | 800×600 | 2 | Large monochrome games |
| MODE 5 | 1024×768 | 2 | Large monochrome games |

**MODE 2 (320×240, 16 colours)** is the sweet spot for game development. It provides a full 16-colour RGB121 palette, fast framebuffer operations, and is the recommended mode for the TILEMAP and RAY engines.

On RP2350 hardware, additional VGA222 modes offer 64 colours at various resolutions.

### SPI LCD Panels

Supported panels include ILI9341 (320×240), ST7789 (240×240 or 320×240), ST7796 (480×320), ILI9488 (480×320), and many more. On RP2350, buffered SPI variants (e.g., ST7796SPBUFF, ILI9341BUFF) support full framebuffer compositing, making them viable for game development.

### The RGB121 Palette

Most game subsystems (TILEMAP, RAY, BLIT operations) work with the 4-bit RGB121 palette:

| Index | Colour | Index | Colour |
|-------|--------|-------|--------|
| 0 | BLACK | 8 | RED |
| 1 | BLUE | 9 | MAGENTA |
| 2 | MYRTLE | 10 | RUST |
| 3 | COBALT | 11 | FUCHSIA |
| 4 | MIDGREEN | 12 | BROWN |
| 5 | CERULEAN | 13 | LILAC |
| 6 | GREEN | 14 | YELLOW |
| 7 | CYAN | 15 | WHITE |

### Recolouring Without Redrawing - the MAP Command

Those sixteen slots are not fixed colours: they are *indexes*. What each one
looks like is decided by the display at scanout, from a sixteen-entry colour
map. Change the map and everything already on the screen in that slot changes
colour - with no redraw, and no per-frame cost at all.

That makes it the cheapest animation on the machine. A pulsing crystal, a
throbbing force field, a warning lamp, water shifting between shades, a power-up
that glints: draw the object once in a reserved slot, then just move the map.

```basic
CONST GLOW = 10                    ' a slot nothing else in the artwork uses
DIM INTEGER glow(5), phase
glow(0) = RGB(0,0,96)    : glow(1) = RGB(0,64,160)  : glow(2) = RGB(0,128,224)
glow(3) = RGB(96,192,255): glow(4) = RGB(0,128,224) : glow(5) = RGB(0,64,160)

' ... draw the crystal once, using colour GLOW ...

DO
  phase = (phase + 1) MOD 6
  MAP(GLOW) = glow(phase)
  MAP SET                          ' commits every pending change at once
  ' ... the rest of the frame ...
LOOP
```

`MAP SET` is what makes staged changes live, so several slots can be moved and
committed together. `MAP RESET` puts the standard sixteen back.

Four things to know before relying on it:

**Reserve the slot.** The map is global. Recolour a slot your hero's sprite also
uses and your hero changes colour too. Decide early which slots are "effect"
slots and keep the artwork out of them.

**`MAP(i)` does not read back the colour.** As a function it returns the RGB
value that *selects* slot `i`, not the colour that slot is currently showing.
Nothing can ask the display what a slot looks like, so keep your own copy if you
need to know.

**The map survives RUN.** It is display state, not program state. A game that
leaves a slot recoloured finds it still recoloured next run - and so does the
next program the user starts. `MAP RESET : MAP SET` during start-up, and again
on the way out, saves a great deal of confusion.

**Firmware before 6.03.02b8 ignores the map in `SAVE IMAGE`.** Screenshots come
out in the default palette, so a map effect cannot be checked from a saved BMP
on older firmware - look at the screen.

## The Framebuffer — Your Rendering Canvas

Almost all game rendering in MMBasic uses double buffering via the FRAMEBUFFER system. The pattern is simple: draw everything to an off-screen buffer, then copy the finished frame to the display in one operation. This eliminates flicker and tearing.

### Setting Up

```basic
MODE 2                    ' 320x240, 16 colours
CLS
FRAMEBUFFER CREATE        ' Allocate off-screen buffer (F)
FRAMEBUFFER WRITE F       ' Direct all drawing to the framebuffer
```

### The Core Game Loop Pattern

```basic
DO
  FRAMEBUFFER WRITE F     ' Draw to framebuffer
  CLS RGB(BLACK)          ' Clear the frame

  ' --- All your rendering goes here ---
  ' Draw background, tilemap, sprites, HUD, etc.

  FRAMEBUFFER COPY F, N   ' Flip: copy framebuffer to display
  
  ' --- Input and game logic ---
  k$ = INKEY$
  ' Process input, update positions, check collisions...

LOOP UNTIL done%
FRAMEBUFFER CLOSE
```

### Layer Compositing

The framebuffer system supports multiple buffers for compositing:

| Buffer | Name | Purpose |
|--------|------|---------|
| **N** | Display | The physical screen |
| **F** | Framebuffer | Primary off-screen buffer |
| **L** | Layer | Secondary overlay buffer |
| **T** | Top Layer | Additional overlay (RP2350 VGA/HDMI) |
| **2** | Second FB | Second framebuffer (VGA/HDMI) |

Use `FRAMEBUFFER LAYER` to create the layer buffer for overlaying HUD elements, particle effects, or other transparent overlays on top of the game world. How the layer is composited onto the display depends on your output type — this is a key difference between LCD and VGA/HDMI builds.

### LCD Displays: Explicit MERGE

On LCD builds (SPI or parallel panels), layer compositing is performed explicitly using `FRAMEBUFFER MERGE` or `BLIT MERGE`. These commands take the Layer buffer, overlay it on top of the Framebuffer with a transparency colour, and send the composited result directly to the physical LCD. Neither the Layer nor the Framebuffer is modified — only the LCD receives the merged output.

```basic
' LCD layer compositing
FRAMEBUFFER CREATE
FRAMEBUFFER LAYER
FRAMEBUFFER WRITE F
' ... draw game world on framebuffer ...
FRAMEBUFFER WRITE L
CLS 0                         ' Clear layer, colour 0 = transparent
TEXT 10, 10, "SCORE: 1000"    ' Draw HUD on layer
FRAMEBUFFER MERGE 0           ' Composite layer over framebuffer, send to LCD
```

Use `BLIT MERGE` to composite only a sub-rectangle (e.g., just the HUD area) for better performance. Background and repeating modes let the merge run on core 1, freeing the main core for game logic.

### VGA / HDMI Displays: Automatic Layer Compositing

On VGA and HDMI builds, `FRAMEBUFFER MERGE` and `BLIT MERGE` **do not exist**. Instead, layer compositing happens automatically as part of the scanline output — the hardware renders the Layer buffer on top of the display buffer every frame with no explicit command needed.

Simply draw to the Layer buffer and the compositing is handled for you:

```basic
' VGA/HDMI layer compositing (automatic)
FRAMEBUFFER CREATE
FRAMEBUFFER LAYER
FRAMEBUFFER WRITE L
CLS 0                         ' Clear layer, colour 0 = transparent
TEXT 10, 10, "SCORE: 1000"    ' Draw HUD on layer
FRAMEBUFFER WRITE F
' ... draw game world on framebuffer ...
FRAMEBUFFER COPY F, N         ' Copy framebuffer to display — layer is composited automatically
```

On RP2350 VGA/HDMI in certain modes (MODE 2, 3, 5), a **Top Layer** (`T`) is also available via `FRAMEBUFFER LAYER TOP`, creating a three-layer composite with this priority order:

1. **Top Layer (T)** — highest priority (checked first)
2. **Layer (L)** — middle priority
3. **Display (N)** — base layer (shown where the layers above are transparent)

Each layer has its own transparency colour. This allows separating different overlay elements — for example, the Layer for in-game particle effects and the Top Layer for a fixed HUD.

### Writing Portable Code

If your game needs to run on both LCD and VGA/HDMI hardware, structure the rendering so that the layer compositing step can differ:

```basic
FRAMEBUFFER CREATE
FRAMEBUFFER LAYER

DO
  FRAMEBUFFER WRITE F
  ' ... draw game world ...
  FRAMEBUFFER WRITE L
  CLS 0
  ' ... draw HUD/overlays ...

  ' For LCD: composite and send to display
  ' FRAMEBUFFER MERGE 0

  ' For VGA/HDMI: just copy framebuffer, layer composites automatically
  FRAMEBUFFER COPY F, N
LOOP
```

## Approach 1: Sprite-Based Games

The SPRITE engine is ideal for **arcade-style games** with individual moving objects — shooters, platformers, Pong, Breakout, top-down RPGs, and similar. It provides hardware-accelerated sprite management with automatic collision detection.

### Key Capabilities

- **Up to 64 sprites** (numbered 1–64)
- **5 layers** (0–4) for z-ordering
- **Automatic collision detection**: sprite-to-sprite, sprite-to-edge, sprite-to-static-object
- **Background preservation**: sprites save and restore the background beneath them
- **Rotation and mirroring** (8 orientations)
- **Batch movement** via SPRITE NEXT / SPRITE MOVE
- **Background scrolling** with wrap-around (SPRITE SCROLL)

### Loading Sprites

Sprites can be loaded from several sources:

```basic
' From a .spr text file (compact, easy to edit)
SPRITE LOAD "player.spr", 1

' From a BMP image
SPRITE LOADBMP #1, "hero.bmp"

' From a PNG with alpha (RP2350 only)
SPRITE LOADPNG #1, "hero.png"

' From an array (procedurally generated)
DIM INTEGER pixels%(255)
' ... fill array ...
SPRITE LOADARRAY #1, 16, 16, pixels%()

' Capture from screen
SPRITE READ #5, 100, 100, 32, 32
```

**Sprite file format (.spr):** A simple text format where the first line defines `width, count [, height]` and each sprite is defined row-by-row using hex colour characters (0–9, A–F). Spaces are transparent. Lines starting with `'` are comments.

### Creating Copies

If you need multiple instances of the same sprite (e.g., a swarm of enemies), use SPRITE COPY to share image data efficiently:

```basic
SPRITE LOAD "enemy.spr", 1        ' Load the template
SPRITE COPY #1, #2, 9             ' Create 9 copies: sprites #2 through #10
```

### Displaying and Moving

```basic
' Show a sprite at position (100, 50) on layer 1
SPRITE SHOW #1, 100, 50, 1

' Move it (simple approach)
SPRITE SHOW #1, 110, 50, 1        ' Redraws at new position

' Move with overlap safety (slower but correct when sprites overlap)
SPRITE SHOW SAFE #1, 110, 50, 1

' Batch movement (most efficient for multiple sprites)
SPRITE NEXT #1, 110, 50
SPRITE NEXT #2, 200, 100
SPRITE NEXT #3, 50, 150
SPRITE MOVE                        ' All three move simultaneously
```

### Animation via Sprite Swapping

The most efficient animation technique is SPRITE SWAP — load multiple animation frames into separate buffers, then swap between them:

```basic
SPRITE LOAD "walk.spr", 1         ' Loads multiple frames into buffers 1, 2, 3, 4
SPRITE SHOW #1, 100, 100, 1       ' Display frame 1

' In game loop:
frame% = (frame% MOD 4) + 1
SPRITE SWAP #displayed%, #frame%   ' Swap to next animation frame
```

### Collision Detection

The sprite engine provides three types of collision detection:

**1. Sprite-to-Sprite Collisions**
```basic
SPRITE INTERRUPT collision_handler

' In the interrupt handler:
collision_handler:
  who% = SPRITE(S)                    ' Which sprite triggered it?
  count% = SPRITE(C, #who%)           ' How many collisions?
  FOR i% = 1 TO count%
    other% = SPRITE(C, #who%, i%)     ' What did it hit?
    IF other% < &h80 THEN
      PRINT "Hit sprite"; other%
    ENDIF
  NEXT i%
  IRETURN
```

**2. Screen Edge Collisions**
```basic
edges% = SPRITE(E, #1)
IF edges% AND 1 THEN PRINT "Hit left edge"
IF edges% AND 4 THEN PRINT "Hit right edge"
```

**3. Static Object Collisions** — invisible rectangular trigger zones:
```basic
' Define walls and platforms
SPRITE STATIC #1, 0, 0, 320, 10        ' Top wall
SPRITE STATIC #2, 0, 230, 320, 10      ' Bottom wall
SPRITE STINTERRUPT wall_hit

wall_hit:
  spr% = SPRITE(ST, COLLISION)          ' Which sprite hit?
  obj% = SPRITE(ST, OBJECT)             ' Which static object?
  IRETURN
```

**4. Background Pixel Collision** — tests sprite pixels against the background:
```basic
result% = SPRITE(B, #1)
IF result% = 2 THEN
  ' Pixel-level collision with background
  push_left% = SPRITE(B, #1, 4)        ' Penetration from left
  push_right% = SPRITE(B, #1, 5)       ' Penetration from right
ENDIF
```

### Utility Functions

```basic
SPRITE(X, #n)       ' X position (-10000 if not displayed)
SPRITE(Y, #n)       ' Y position
SPRITE(W, #n)       ' Width in pixels
SPRITE(H, #n)       ' Height in pixels
SPRITE(L, #n)       ' Layer (-1 if not displayed)
SPRITE(D, #n1, #n2) ' Distance between two sprites
SPRITE(V, #n1, #n2) ' Angle from sprite #n1 to #n2 (radians)
SPRITE(N)            ' Number of displayed sprites
```

### Background Scrolling

For side-scrolling games, SPRITE SCROLL moves the background and all layer-0 sprites together:

```basic
SPRITE SCROLL 2, 0, -2    ' Scroll right by 2 pixels, wrap-around
' Layer 0 sprites scroll with background
' Layers 1-4 remain fixed (good for HUD elements)
```

---

## Approach 2: Tile Map Games

The TILEMAP engine (RP2350 only) is designed for **2D scrolling worlds** — platformers, top-down adventure games, puzzle games, and anything with a tile-based world. It provides hardware-accelerated rendering of large maps with sub-tile smooth scrolling.

### Why Use TILEMAP?

Drawing a 320×240 viewport with 16×16 tiles requires rendering ~336 tiles per frame. Doing this from BASIC with individual BLIT calls would be far too slow. TILEMAP DRAW does it all in a single C-level call with automatic viewport clipping and sub-tile scrolling.

### Setting Up a Tile Map

**Step 1: Prepare a tileset image** — a BMP with all tiles arranged in a grid (e.g., 256×64 pixels = 64 tiles of 16×16):

```basic
FLASH LOAD IMAGE 1, "tileset.bmp"
```

**Step 2: Define the map in DATA statements:**

```basic
TILEMAP CREATE mapdata, 1, 1, 16, 16, 16, 20, 15
' Parameters: label, slot, flash_slot, tileW, tileH, tiles_per_row, cols, rows
END

mapdata:
DATA 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
DATA 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
' ... more rows ...
DATA 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1
```

Tile index 0 is always empty (transparent). Indices 1+ reference tiles from the tileset image.

**Step 3: Define tile attributes** for collision:

```basic
CONST SOLID = &b0001
CONST LADDER = &b0010
CONST DAMAGE = &b0100
CONST COLLECT = &b1000

TILEMAP ATTR attrdata, 1, 6
END

attrdata:
DATA 0            ' Tile 1: passable
DATA SOLID        ' Tile 2: solid brick
DATA SOLID        ' Tile 3: solid stone
DATA LADDER       ' Tile 4: ladder
DATA COLLECT      ' Tile 5: coin
DATA DAMAGE       ' Tile 6: spikes
```

### Rendering the Map

```basic
' Draw the visible viewport
TILEMAP DRAW 1, F, camX, camY, 0, 0, 320, 240

' With transparency (for overlay layers)
TILEMAP DRAW 1, F, camX, camY, 0, 0, 320, 240, 0
```

The viewport coordinates (`camX`, `camY`) provide pixel-precise smooth scrolling. Partially visible tiles at edges are automatically clipped.

### Camera Control

```basic
' Follow the player
camX = playerX - 160
camY = playerY - 120

' Or use built-in scroll with clamping
TILEMAP SCROLL 1, 2, 0       ' Scroll right 2 pixels (auto-clamps to bounds)
camX = TILEMAP(VIEWX 1)
camY = TILEMAP(VIEWY 1)

' Or set absolute position
TILEMAP VIEW 1, playerX - 160, playerY - 120
```

### Tile-Based Collision Detection

The TILEMAP engine includes attribute-based collision — define what each tile *type* means (solid, ladder, collectible, etc.) and test rectangular regions against the map:

```basic
' Movement with solid-tile blocking
CONST SOLID = &b0001
newX% = px% + speed%
IF TILEMAP(COLLISION 1, newX%, py%, 14, 22, SOLID) = 0 THEN
  px% = newX%        ' No solid obstacle — allow movement
ENDIF

' Gravity with landing detection
newY% = py% + velY%
IF TILEMAP(COLLISION 1, px%, newY%, 14, 22, SOLID) = 0 THEN
  py% = newY%        ' Falling
ELSE
  velY% = 0          ' Landed
  py% = (newY% \ 16) * 16 - 22   ' Snap to tile boundary
ENDIF

' Collectible pickup
t% = TILEMAP(TILE 1, px% + 8, py% + 12)
IF t% > 0 AND (TILEMAP(ATTR 1, t%) AND COLLECT) THEN
  TILEMAP SET 1, (px% + 8) \ 16, (py% + 12) \ 16, 0   ' Remove coin
  score% = score% + 100
ENDIF
```

### TILEMAP Sprites

The TILEMAP system includes its own lightweight sprite layer for game entities. These sprites reference tiles from the tilemap's tileset and are rendered in batch for performance:

```basic
' Create player sprite using tile 7 from tilemap 1's tileset
TILEMAP SPRITE CREATE 1, 1, 7, 160, 120

' Move it
TILEMAP SPRITE MOVE 1, playerX%, playerY%

' Animate by changing tiles
IF frame% MOD 10 < 5 THEN
  TILEMAP SPRITE SET 1, 7     ' Walk frame A
ELSE
  TILEMAP SPRITE SET 1, 8     ' Walk frame B
ENDIF

' Draw all sprites in one call
TILEMAP SPRITE DRAW F, 0      ' F = framebuffer, 0 = transparent colour

' Check sprite-sprite collision
IF TILEMAP(SPRITE HIT 1, 2) THEN PRINT "Player hit enemy!"
```

### Parallax Scrolling

Use multiple tilemaps with different scroll rates for a parallax effect:

```basic
FLASH LOAD IMAGE 1, "bg_tiles.bmp"
FLASH LOAD IMAGE 2, "fg_tiles.bmp"

TILEMAP CREATE bgdata, 1, 1, 16, 16, 8, 50, 15    ' Background
TILEMAP CREATE fgdata, 2, 2, 16, 16, 16, 100, 15   ' Foreground

' In game loop:
TILEMAP DRAW 1, F, camX\2, camY\2, 0, 0, 320, 240          ' BG at half speed
TILEMAP DRAW 2, F, camX, camY, 0, 0, 320, 240, 0            ' FG with transparency
TILEMAP SPRITE DRAW F, 0                                      ' Sprites on top
```

### Dynamic Maps

Modify the map at runtime for interactive elements:

```basic
TILEMAP SET 1, col%, row%, 0       ' Remove a tile (e.g., collected coin)
TILEMAP SET 1, col%, row%, 3       ' Place a tile (e.g., close a door)
```

### Memory Efficiency

Map data is stored internally as `uint16_t` (2 bytes per cell), far more efficient than using BASIC integer arrays (8 bytes each). A 200×30 map uses only 12 KB.

---

## Approach 3: First-Person 3D (Raycaster)

The RAY engine (RP2350 only) provides a **Wolfenstein 3D-style first-person renderer** with textured walls, patterned floors/ceilings, billboard sprites, sliding doors, and built-in collision detection.

### Quick Start

```basic
MODE 2
CLS

DIM m$(3) LENGTH 4
m$(0) = "1111"
m$(1) = "1001"
m$(2) = "1001"
m$(3) = "1111"

FRAMEBUFFER CREATE
FRAMEBUFFER WRITE F

RAY MAP 4, 4, m$()
RAY CAMERA 2.5, 2.5, 0, 66
RAY COLOUR 12, 3, 8, 1, 1, 3    ' Floor/ceiling colours and patterns

DO
  RAY RENDER                      ' Render the 3D scene
  FRAMEBUFFER COPY F, N           ' Display
  k$ = INKEY$
  IF k$ = "w" THEN RAY MOVE 0.1
  IF k$ = "s" THEN RAY MOVE -0.1
  IF k$ = "a" THEN RAY TURN -5
  IF k$ = "d" THEN RAY TURN 5
LOOP UNTIL k$ = CHR$(27)

RAY CLOSE
FRAMEBUFFER CLOSE
```

### Map Definition

Maps use a grid where each cell is either empty (0) or a wall type (1–31). The string-array format uses just 1 byte per cell:

```basic
DIM m$(50) LENGTH 57
m$(0) = "111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111"
m$(1) = "100000000000000000000000000001000000000000000000000000001"
' ... etc ...
```

Characters `0`=empty, `1`–`9`=wall types 1–9, `A`–`Z`=wall types 10–35.

### Wall Customisation

Each wall type has configurable appearance using fill patterns:

```basic
RAY DEFINE 1, 8, 10, 3        ' Type 1: red/rust, pattern 3
RAY DEFINE 2, 6, 4, 5         ' Type 2: green/midgreen, pattern 5
RAY DEFINE 7, 1, 3, 6, 1      ' Type 7: blue door (door flag=1)
```

### Movement with Collision

`RAY MOVE` handles collision detection automatically — the player slides along walls:

```basic
RAY MOVE 0.15                  ' Move forward
RAY MOVE -0.15                 ' Move backward
RAY MOVE 0.15, 0.1             ' Forward + strafe right
RAY TURN 5                     ' Rotate 5° clockwise
```

### Sliding Doors

Up to 8 doors can animate simultaneously:

```basic
' Animate opening over multiple frames
door_offset! = 0.0
DO WHILE door_offset! < 1.0
  door_offset! = door_offset! + 0.1
  RAY DOOR door_x%, door_y%, door_offset!
  RAY RENDER
  FRAMEBUFFER COPY F, N
  PAUSE 50
LOOP
```

### Billboard Sprites

Place 2D sprites in the 3D world — they always face the camera and are depth-sorted automatically:

```basic
SPRITE LOADARRAY 1, 16, 16, enemy_img%()   ' Load sprite image
RAY SPRITE 0, 1, 5.5, 3.5                   ' Place at world position

' Move a sprite
RAY SPRITE 0, 1, newX!, newY!

' Remove
RAY SPRITE REMOVE 0
```

### Ray Casting for Interaction

Cast a single ray to detect what the player is looking at — useful for "use" buttons, shooting, or proximity checks:

```basic
RAY CAST RAY(CAMA)             ' Cast in camera direction
IF RAY(CASTDIST) < 2.0 THEN
  wall_type% = RAY(CASTWALL)
  cell_x% = RAY(CASTX)
  cell_y% = RAY(CASTY)
  ' Handle interaction...
ENDIF
```

### Minimap Overlay

```basic
RAY RENDER
RAY MINIMAP 2, 2, 48           ' Draw minimap at (2,2), 48px wide
FRAMEBUFFER COPY F, N
```

---

## Approach 4: 3D Object Graphics

The DRAW3D system provides **quaternion-based 3D rendering** for displaying and rotating solid objects — useful for 3D puzzle games, object viewers, rotating logos, or in-game 3D elements.

### Key Features

- Up to 8 objects, 3 cameras
- Quaternion rotation (no gimbal lock)
- Depth-sorted face rendering
- Surface normal hidden-face removal
- Configurable lighting with ambient levels
- Per-face colour, edge colour, and fill colour

### Creating a 3D Object

Objects are defined by vertices, faces, and colours:

```basic
DIM vertex(7, 2) AS FLOAT       ' 8 vertices × 3 coordinates
DIM facecount(5) AS INTEGER     ' 6 faces (cube)
DIM faces(23) AS INTEGER        ' 6 faces × 4 vertices each
DIM colours(6) AS INTEGER       ' Colour palette
DIM linecolour(5) AS INTEGER    ' Edge colour per face
DIM fillcolour(5) AS INTEGER    ' Fill colour per face

' ... fill arrays with vertex/face data ...

3D CAMERA 1, 400                ' Set up camera (viewplane distance = 400)
3D CREATE 1, 8, 6, 1, vertex(), facecount(), faces(), colours(), linecolour(), fillcolour()
```

### Rotation with Quaternions

```basic
DIM quat(4) AS FLOAT
angle! = RAD(10)
quat(0) = COS(angle!/2)         ' w
quat(1) = 0                     ' x
quat(2) = SIN(angle!/2)         ' y (rotate around Y axis)
quat(3) = 0                     ' z
quat(4) = 1                     ' magnitude

3D RESET 1                      ' Reset to original orientation
3D ROTATE quat(), 1             ' Apply rotation
3D SHOW 1, 0, 0, 200            ' Display at (0, 0, z=200)
```

### Lighting

```basic
3D LIGHT 1, -100, 100, -50, 30  ' Light position + 30% ambient
3D SET FLAGS 1, 8, 0, 6         ' Enable lighting on all 6 faces
```

## Drawing Primitives

MMBasic provides a complete set of drawing primitives that are essential for backgrounds, HUD elements, particle effects, and any custom rendering.

### Available Primitives

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `PIXEL x, y, colour` | Set/read individual pixels |
| `LINE (x1,y1)-(x2,y2), colour, width` | Lines with variable width |
| `BOX x, y, w, h, linewidth, colour, fill` | Rectangles |
| `RBOX x, y, w, h, radius, colour, fill` | Rounded rectangles |
| `CIRCLE x, y, r, linewidth, colour, fill` | Circles and ellipses |
| `ARC x, y, r, start, end, colour` | Arcs and wedges |
| `TRIANGLE x0,y0,x1,y1,x2,y2, colour, fill` | Triangles |
| `POLYGON n, x(), y(), colour, fill` | N-sided polygons |
| `BEZIER x0,y0,x1,y1,x2,y2,x3,y3, colour` | Bezier curves |
| `FILL x, y, colour` | Flood fill |
| `TEXT x, y, str$, just, font, scale, fc, bc` | Render text |
| `CLS colour` | Clear screen/buffer |

### Using Primitives for Game Graphics

**Health bar:**
```basic
BOX 10, 5, 100, 10, 1, RGB(WHITE), RGB(BLACK)      ' Border
BOX 11, 6, health%, 8, 0, RGB(RED), RGB(RED)        ' Fill
```

**Particle effects:**
```basic
FOR i% = 0 TO num_particles%
  PIXEL px%(i%), py%(i%), RGB(YELLOW)
  py%(i%) = py%(i%) + vy%(i%)
  vy%(i%) = vy%(i%) + 1                              ' Gravity
NEXT i%
```

**Radar/minimap:**
```basic
CIRCLE radar_x%, radar_y%, 30, 1, RGB(GREEN)
FOR i% = 0 TO num_enemies%
  dx% = enemy_x%(i%) - player_x%
  dy% = enemy_y%(i%) - player_y%
  PIXEL radar_x% + dx%/scale%, radar_y% + dy%/scale%, RGB(RED)
NEXT i%
```

---

## BLIT Operations — Fast Image Transfer

The BLIT commands provide fast block transfer of rectangular pixel regions between buffers. These are the workhorses for custom rendering pipelines.

### Key BLIT Commands

| Command | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `BLIT FLASH slot, dst, sx, sy, dx, dy, w, h [, trans]` | Draw from flash image to buffer |
| `BLIT FRAMEBUFFER src, dst, x1, y1, x2, y2, w, h [, trans]` | Copy between F/L/N/T buffers |
| `BLIT RESIZE src, dst, sx, sy, sw, sh, dx, dy, dw, dh [, trans]` | Scale/resize between buffers |
| `BLIT MERGE trans, x, y, w, h` | Partial-area layer merge |
| `BLIT LOAD #n, "file.bmp"` | Load BMP into blit buffer |

### FLASH-Based Image System

For games that need to draw background images, tile-like elements, or UI graphics without an SD card at runtime, load BMPs into flash once and blit from flash during gameplay:

```basic
' One-time setup (load assets into flash)
FLASH LOAD IMAGE 1, "background.bmp"
FLASH LOAD IMAGE 2, "ui_elements.bmp"

' During gameplay — blit from flash to framebuffer
BLIT FLASH 1, F, 0, 0, 0, 0, 320, 240              ' Full background
BLIT FLASH 2, F, 0, 0, 250, 5, 64, 16, 0           ' UI element with transparency
```

### Installing Assets Once - and Knowing They Are Yours

`FLASH LOAD IMAGE` erases and rewrites a whole flash slot. That takes a
noticeable moment and wears the flash, so a game that does it on every run pays
for it every run. Write the slot once, then check it.

The check is built in: **without `OVERWRITE`, `FLASH LOAD IMAGE` refuses with
"Already programmed" when the slot is in use.** A skipped error is therefore the
program asking "has this already been done?":

```basic
SUB InstallImage(slot, file$)
  LOCAL e$
  ON ERROR CLEAR                  ' so a stale error cannot be mistaken for ours
  ON ERROR SKIP 1
  FLASH LOAD IMAGE slot, file$
  e$ = MM.ERRMSG$
  ON ERROR CLEAR
  IF e$ <> "" AND INSTR(e$, "Already programmed") = 0 THEN ERROR e$
END SUB
```

That answers "is something in the slot?" but not "is it *mine*?", and the
difference matters more than it sounds. The user may have another game's images
in those slots, and your own artwork changes between versions. Loading the wrong
sheet does not crash - it draws a plausible-looking picture made of the wrong
squares, which is a far more baffling bug report than a crash would be.

A flash image begins with its own dimensions, so start there:

```basic
LOCAL a
a = MM.INFO(FLASH ADDRESS slot)
IF PEEK(WORD a) <> wantW OR PEEK(WORD a + 4) <> wantH THEN
  ERROR "FLASH ERASE " + STR$(slot) + ", then run again"
ENDIF
```

**But the same size does not mean the same picture.** If a new version of your
artwork renumbers the tiles without changing the sheet's dimensions, the size
check passes and the map cheerfully indexes the old tiles. To catch that,
compare a few words of the picture itself. What `FLASH LOAD IMAGE` stores is
exactly determined by the BMP, so a build script can work out what those words
must be and emit them as `DATA`:

| Offset | Contents |
|--------|----------|
| 0 | image width, 32-bit |
| 4 | image height, 32-bit |
| 8 onward | the picture, **top row first**, `width / 2` bytes per row |

Each byte holds two pixels with the **left one in the low nibble**. The nibble
is the RGB121 code - red bit 7, green bits 7 and 6, blue bit 7 of the colour -
which is *not* the BMP's own palette index, so a build script must put the BMP
palette through the same conversion. Sample words from several places in the
image, and skip any that come out blank: a run of zeroes matches any other
image's blank run and proves nothing.

Note the ordering. BMPs store their rows bottom-up, but the flash image is
written top row first, so the *last* row in the file is the *first* in flash.

### Scaling with BLIT RESIZE

```basic
' Scale a 64x64 region up to 128x96
BLIT RESIZE F, L, 32, 16, 64, 64, 100, 40, 128, 96

' Scale with transparency
BLIT RESIZE F, L, 32, 16, 64, 64, 100, 40, 128, 96, 0
```

---

## Input Handling

Games need responsive input. MMBasic offers several options depending on your hardware.

### Keyboard Input

**INKEY$** — simple single-key polling:
```basic
k$ = INKEY$
IF k$ = "w" THEN move_forward
IF k$ = CHR$(27) THEN quit
```

**KEYDOWN** — simultaneous key detection (up to 7 keys):
```basic
IF KEYDOWN(128) THEN move_up       ' Up arrow
IF KEYDOWN(129) THEN move_down     ' Down arrow
IF KEYDOWN(130) THEN move_left     ' Left arrow
IF KEYDOWN(131) THEN move_right    ' Right arrow
IF KEYDOWN(32) THEN fire           ' Space
n% = KEYDOWN(0)                    ' Number of keys currently pressed
```

**Press versus hold.** `KEYDOWN` reports what is held *now*, so
`IF KEYDOWN(32) THEN Fire` fires on every frame the key is down. For actions
that should happen once per press - jump, a single shot, opening a door,
changing weapon - remember what was held last frame and require a release
first:

```basic
DIM INTEGER kNow(255), kWas(255)

SUB ReadKeys
  LOCAL INTEGER i, n
  FOR i = 0 TO 255 : kWas(i) = kNow(i) : kNow(i) = 0 : NEXT i
  n = KEYDOWN(0)
  FOR i = 1 TO n : kNow(KEYDOWN(i)) = 1 : NEXT i
END SUB

FUNCTION Held(k)    : Held = kNow(k) : END FUNCTION
FUNCTION Pressed(k) : Pressed = kNow(k) AND kWas(k) = 0 : END FUNCTION
```

Call `ReadKeys` once at the top of the frame - never twice, or the second call
overwrites the previous state and `Pressed()` never fires. Then use `Held()` for
movement and thrust, `Pressed()` for everything else. Keep the whole key set in
one array and the two behaviours stay one line apart rather than scattered
through the game.

**Do not mix `INKEY$` and `KEYDOWN` for the same key.** `INKEY$` takes a
keypress out of the console buffer; `KEYDOWN` reports the physical state of the
keyboard. Consuming a key with `INKEY$` does *not* stop `KEYDOWN` reporting it
as still down until it is physically released, so a game that reads both will
act on the same press twice. Pick one and use it throughout.

**Testing note:** writing key codes to the console over a serial link does not
drive a `KEYDOWN` loop - a `KEYDOWN` call clears pending console input as a side
effect. A game built on `KEYDOWN` can only be driven from a real keyboard, so
plan another way to test it automatically.

### USB Gamepad (USB Keyboard Builds)

## Sound and Music

MMBasic provides comprehensive audio capabilities from simple beeps to multi-channel synthesis.

### Simple Tones

```basic
PLAY TONE 440, 440, 200           ' 440Hz both channels, 200ms
```

### Multi-Channel Synthesizer

Up to multiple simultaneous sound channels with selectable waveforms:

```basic
' Channel 1: sine wave, 440Hz, left speaker, volume 50
PLAY SOUND 1, L, S, 440, 50

' Channel 2: square wave, 220Hz, right speaker, volume 30
PLAY SOUND 2, R, Q, 220, 30

' Available waveforms: Sine, sQuare, Triangle, saWtooth, Noise, Pink, User, Off
```

### Playing Audio Files

```basic
PLAY WAV "explosion.wav"
PLAY FLAC "music.flac"
PLAY MP3 "bgmusic.mp3"
PLAY MODFILE "chiptune.mod"        ' Amiga MOD tracker files!
```

### MOD Files and Sound Effects with PLAY MODSAMPLE

Amiga MOD tracker files are an excellent choice for game background music — they are compact, loop naturally, and have an authentic retro sound. MMBasic plays them via `PLAY MODFILE`, which uses 4 tracker channels to mix the music in real time.

The key advantage for game developers is `PLAY MODSAMPLE`, which lets you trigger individual samples *from the loaded MOD file* as one-shot sound effects **while the music continues playing**. MOD files contain up to 32 embedded instrument samples (explosions, bleeps, thuds, etc.), and you can play any of them on demand over the top of the background music using up to 4 dedicated sound-effect channels.

**Syntax:**
```basic
PLAY MODSAMPLE sample_number, channel [, volume]
```

| Parameter | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `sample_number` | Sample number within the MOD file (1–32) |
| `channel` | Sound effect channel (1–4) |
| `volume` | Optional playback volume (0–64, default 63) |

This means you can design your MOD file to serve double duty: the tracker patterns provide background music, while unused or dedicated samples in the same file provide your entire sound-effect library. No additional WAV files, no extra memory, no audio channel conflicts.

**Practical example — background music with sound effects:**
```basic
' Start the background music
PLAY MODFILE "game.mod"

' Later, during gameplay:
PLAY MODSAMPLE 5, 1            ' Trigger sample 5 (e.g., laser) on effect channel 1
PLAY MODSAMPLE 8, 2, 40        ' Trigger sample 8 (e.g., coin) on channel 2 at volume 40
PLAY MODSAMPLE 12, 3           ' Trigger sample 12 (e.g., explosion) on channel 3
```

**Tips for using MODSAMPLE in games:**
- Compose your MOD file in a tracker (e.g., OpenMPT, MilkyTracker) with samples designated for sound effects — put them in higher sample slots (e.g., 17–32) so they are easy to identify
- Use different effect channels for different sound categories (e.g., channel 1 for weapons, channel 2 for pickups, channel 3 for UI) so that rapid-fire sounds replace only their own category
- The sound effects mix with the MOD music automatically — no additional code for mixing is needed
- If you trigger a new sample on a channel that is already playing an effect, the new sample replaces the previous one on that channel

### Wavetable Synthesis with ADSR (RP2350)

For sophisticated sound effects, PLAY SAMPLE provides a wavetable synthesizer with per-channel ADSR envelopes:

```basic
' Define a sine waveform
CONST N = 256
DIM INTEGER wave%(N - 1)
FOR i% = 0 TO N - 1
  wave%(i%) = INT(SIN(2 * PI * i% / N) * 32000)
NEXT i%

' Play with ADSR envelope (attack=50ms, decay=100ms, sustain=60%, release=200ms)
PLAY SAMPLE wave%(), wave%(), 440, 50, 100, 60, 200

' Trigger release (note fades out)
PLAY RELEASE
```

### Volume Control

```basic
PLAY VOLUME 80, 80                 ' Left, right (0-100)
PLAY PAUSE                         ' Pause audio
PLAY RESUME                        ' Resume audio
```

---

## Text UI with FRAME

The FRAME system provides a character-cell based panel system for HUDs, menus, inventories, and dialogue boxes. It works on both VGA displays and serial terminals.

```basic
FRAME CREATE
FRAME BOX 0, 0, 40, 3             ' Create a panel
FRAME TITLE 1, "STATUS"
FRAME PRINT 1, "HP: 100  MP: 50  Gold: 1234"
FRAME WRITE                        ' Render to screen
```

FRAME is especially useful for text-adventure style games, RPG interfaces, or overlaying text HUDs on graphical games.

## Structuring a Game

### Game Architecture Pattern

Most MMBasic games follow a common structure:

```basic
OPTION EXPLICIT

' ===== Constants =====
CONST SCREEN_W = 320
CONST SCREEN_H = 240

' ===== Initialisation =====
MODE 2
CLS
FRAMEBUFFER CREATE
FRAMEBUFFER WRITE F

' Load assets
SPRITE LOAD "player.spr", 1
SPRITE LOAD "enemies.spr", 10
' FLASH LOAD IMAGE 1, "tiles.bmp"
' TILEMAP CREATE ...

' Set up game state
DIM INTEGER score%, lives%, level%, gameOver%
DIM FLOAT playerX!, playerY!, playerVelX!, playerVelY!
playerX! = 160 : playerY! = 120 : lives% = 3

' Set up interrupts
' SPRITE INTERRUPT collision_handler
' SETTICK 16, game_tick              ' 60 FPS timer

' ===== Main Game Loop =====
DO
  ' --- Input ---
  k$ = INKEY$
  IF KEYDOWN(130) THEN playerVelX! = playerVelX! - 0.5
  IF KEYDOWN(131) THEN playerVelX! = playerVelX! + 0.5
  IF KEYDOWN(128) THEN playerVelY! = playerVelY! - 0.5

  ' --- Update ---
  playerX! = playerX! + playerVelX!
  playerY! = playerY! + playerVelY!
  playerVelX! = playerVelX! * 0.9    ' Friction
  playerVelY! = playerVelY! * 0.9
  ' ... update enemies, projectiles, physics ...

  ' --- Render ---
  CLS RGB(BLACK)
  ' Draw background / tilemap
  ' Draw sprites / entities
  ' Draw HUD
  TEXT 5, 5, "SCORE: " + STR$(score%), , 1, 1, RGB(WHITE), -1

  FRAMEBUFFER COPY F, N              ' Flip

  ' --- Frame timing ---
  PAUSE 16                           ' ~60 FPS cap

LOOP UNTIL gameOver%

' ===== Cleanup =====
SPRITE CLOSE ALL
FRAMEBUFFER CLOSE
END

' ===== Interrupt Handlers =====
' collision_handler:
'   ...
'   IRETURN
```

### Performance Tips

1. **Use MODE 2 (320×240)** — half the pixels of MODE 3, twice the speed
2. **Use FRAMEBUFFER** — always double-buffer to avoid flicker
3. **Use SPRITE NEXT/MOVE** — batch sprite movements are faster than individual SHOW calls
4. **Pre-load assets into flash** — `FLASH LOAD IMAGE` eliminates SD card access during gameplay
5. **Minimise BASIC loops** — use firmware-accelerated commands (TILEMAP DRAW, RAY RENDER, SPRITE MOVE) instead of per-pixel BASIC code
6. **Use integer variables** where possible — suffix with `%` for faster maths
7. **Use OPTION EXPLICIT** — catches typos and forces variable declaration
8. **Use string maps for RAY** — 1 byte per cell vs 8 bytes for integer arrays
9. **Use SPRITE COPY** — shared image data saves memory when you need many identical sprites
10. **Use tile attributes** — one TILEMAP(COLLISION ..., mask) call replaces dozens of individual tile checks
11. **Separate the simulation tick from the draw** - run the game's logic at a
    fixed rate and draw whatever the clock allows, rather than letting the
    physics run as fast as the frame does. A game whose speed depends on how
    much is on screen is very hard to tune, and impossible to reproduce a bug
    in. Time the two halves separately: knowing that a slow frame is 0.3 ms of
    logic and 6.8 ms of drawing tells you immediately which one to attack.
12. **Move the hot loop into a CSUB when interpretation dominates.** Above a
    certain amount of per-object work, the cost is the interpreter reading
    statements, not the arithmetic in them - and no amount of tightening the
    BASIC helps. Rewriting one inner loop in C can be a hundredfold: a
    per-object physics update measured at 9.8 ms in BASIC ran in 0.28 ms as a
    CSUB doing exactly the same arithmetic. Keep the CSUB's state in an integer
    array shared with the BASIC so nothing has to be copied across the boundary
    each call.

### Memory Considerations

PicoMite has limited RAM. Budget carefully:

| Resource | Typical Size |
|----------|-------------|
| Framebuffer (320×240×4bpp) | ~38 KB |
| Layer buffer | ~38 KB |
| Tilemap (200×30) | 12 KB |
| Sprite buffer (32×32) | ~512 bytes |
| 64 sprites (32×32 each) | ~32 KB |
| Raycaster state | ~6.5 KB |
| Flash images | Stored in flash, not RAM |

Use `FLASH LOAD IMAGE` to keep large images in flash rather than RAM. Use SPRITE COPY for multiple instances of the same sprite. Use string-array maps for the raycaster.

---

## Choosing the Right Approach

| Game Type | Recommended Engine |
|-----------|-------------------|
| Arcade shooter | SPRITE engine |
| Pong / Breakout | SPRITE engine + drawing primitives |
| Side-scrolling platformer | TILEMAP + TILEMAP SPRITE |
| Top-down RPG / adventure | TILEMAP + TILEMAP SPRITE |
| Wolfenstein / Doom-like FPS | RAY engine |
| 3D puzzle / object viewer | 3D graphics system |
| Text adventure / RPG menus | FRAME system |
| Board games / card games | Drawing primitives + BLIT |
| Rhythm game | PLAY SAMPLE + drawing primitives |

### Combining Systems

These systems can be combined. For example:

- **TILEMAP + FRAME**: A platformer with a text-based inventory overlay
- **RAY + SPRITE**: A first-person game with billboard sprites for enemies and items
- **3D + drawing primitives**: A rotating 3D object with 2D HUD overlays
- **TILEMAP + PLAY SOUND**: A platformer with multi-channel sound effects
- **Any game + PLAY MODFILE**: Background chiptune music from MOD files

## Porting an Existing Game

If you are bringing a game across from another machine rather than inventing
one, the hardest part is not the graphics - it is knowing whether your version
behaves like the original. A few habits make that tractable.

**Get a reference you can run.** A disassembly you read is not the same as an
implementation you can execute. If you can run the original - in an emulator, or
in a small interpreter for its CPU - you can put it side by side with your port
and compare, which turns "does this feel right?" into a question with an answer.

**Drive both sides with the same randomness.** Record every random number the
original draws, keyed by where it drew it, and feed those numbers to your port
at the matching places. Otherwise the two diverge immediately for reasons that
have nothing to do with your code being wrong.

**Compare all the state, not just the obvious part.** The temptation is to
compare the things you already think about - the objects, the player. Everything
else drifts in silence, and the bug surfaces hours later somewhere unrelated. In
this project the object table was compared for weeks while a single timer
elsewhere was never decremented, which meant no door in the game could open; the
scenes that covered doors all passed. Widening the comparison to the whole of
the shared state found that in one run, and three more bugs with it.

**Prove that each check can fail.** A comparison that has never failed may be
watching nothing at all. Deliberately reintroduce a bug you have fixed and
confirm the harness catches it, and where. This is the cheapest test you will
ever write and it repeatedly finds checks that were quietly disabled.

**Reaching the code is not exercising it.** Coverage tells you a routine ran,
not that it did anything. Three scenes reached the door-handling routine every
time and all passed, while no door was capable of opening.

**Where exactness is impossible, measure the gap instead of hiding it.** Some
original behaviour depends on things your port does not have - reading pixels
back from the screen, for instance, or exact timing. Do not quietly let those
cases pass. Count how often they agree, report the number, and write down why it
cannot be 100%, so that a change making it worse is visible rather than
invisible.

## Shipping a Finished Game

A game that only runs from the root of `A:` is awkward to hand to anyone else.
Two firmware features let it live in a folder on any drive and start with a
single `RUN`.

### Finding your own assets

`MM.INFO(PATH)` is the directory the running program was loaded from. Use it for
every asset path and the game works wherever it is installed:

```basic
DIM home$
home$ = MM.INFO(PATH)
IF home$ = "NONE" THEN home$ = "A:/"
OPEN home$ + "level1.dat" FOR INPUT AS #1
```

The path comes from a `'#filename` header the loader writes as the program's
first line, so it is only available to a program **loaded from a file**. One
that arrived over `AUTOSAVE` has no header and `MM.INFO(PATH)` returns `"NONE"`,
which is why the fallback is worth keeping while developing.

### Code too big for program memory

A large CSUB costs its hex text as well as its compiled code and can easily
exceed program memory. Put it in the library instead - and have the program
install its own, rather than relying on the user having run `LIBRARY SAVE`:

```basic
LIBRARY LOAD MM.INFO(PATH) + "mygame_lib.bas"
OPTION EXPLICIT
' ... the rest of the program ...
```

Three rules come with it:

- **It must be the program's first statement.** The library's own top level runs
  before your program's first line, so one loaded later would arrive too late to
  be initialised. Comment lines ahead of it are fine, including the `'#filename`
  header the loader added.
- **It is idempotent.** The hash of the source is kept in the options, so a
  program doing this on every run reads the file, finds the library already
  matches, and touches no flash at all. Only a *different* library costs
  anything.
- **It restarts the program.** A library cannot be initialised mid-run, so when
  one is written execution begins again at line 1 - where the command is now a
  no-op. Your program sees a clean start, not a resumed one, so do not put
  anything before it that should happen once.

Do not add `OVERWRITE` in a released game. Without it the board asks before
replacing a library that may belong to something the user cares about, and the
question only appears when the library actually differs - so an ordinary run is
silent anyway.

### One RUN from nothing

Put that together with the flash-slot install above and the whole thing is
automatic: the library writes itself and restarts, the flash slots fill if they
are empty and are verified if they are not, and everything else loads from
`home$`. The user copies one folder and types one command. The first run takes a
minute; every run after that starts in a second.

Ship a plain-text README in the same folder. It is the only documentation most
players will ever see, and it is the right place for the keys, the install
command, and what to include in a bug report.

## MMBasic Traps Worth Knowing

A few that are easy to hit and hard to diagnose:

**`RESTORE` to a label, always.** An unqualified `READ` takes the program's
*first* `DATA` statement, wherever that happens to be. Add a generated `DATA`
block ahead of an existing one and the old `READ` silently starts consuming the
new numbers - which surfaces as a nonsense error a long way from the cause.

```basic
RESTORE LevelData
FOR i = 1 TO n : READ tile(i) : NEXT i
LevelData:
DATA 1, 2, 3, 4
```

**`TEXT` with a background colour only erases its own width.** Printing a
shorter string over a longer one leaves the tail of the old one behind. Pad to a
fixed width, or clear the area first.

**Work out how many characters actually fit.** Font 7 is 6 pixels wide, font 1
is 8. A 64-pixel status panel holds ten characters of font 7 and no more, so
`"SCORE 1000"` fits and `"SCORE 10000"` does not - and the overflow is silent.
Count before designing a panel, and leave headroom for the largest value a field
can reach, not the value it shows at the start.

**Names are unique irrespective of type suffix.** `k` and `k$` are the same
name, and a no-argument built-in function name cannot be used as a variable.

**Variables cannot be invented at the prompt** once a program using
`OPTION EXPLICIT` has run, and the command line truncates around 250
characters - both worth knowing when poking at a running game from the console.
