# mmb2csub

*Turning an MMBasic SUB or FUNCTION into a CSUB, without writing any C.*

**Requires PicoMite firmware 6.03.02b9 or later.**

---

## 1. What it is for

Your program is too slow. Somewhere inside it is a routine doing the real work,
and the interpreter is spending most of its time reading that routine rather
than running it. `mmb2csub` compiles that routine to machine code and puts it
back into your program as a CSUB, so the interpreter calls it once instead of
interpreting it a million times.

```
python mmb2csub.py myprogram.bas PlotJulia
```

That rewrites `myprogram.bas`: the original routine is commented out, the CSUB
is appended, and **your call sites do not change** — MMBasic calls a CSUB
exactly as it calls a SUB.

What you can expect:

| what the routine does | speedup |
|---|---|
| loops, array work, integer and float arithmetic | 10–35x |
| transcendental maths (SIN, LOG), string formatting | 3–4x |
| mostly calling the firmware already (graphics, files) | very little |

The Julia set demo in `examples/` is the top row: 119 seconds interpreted on
an RP2040 and 5.9 converted, 86 seconds and 2.5 on an RP2350 - 20x and 35x,
from the same file, drawing a byte-identical image on both. The RP2350 gains
more because its processor runs compiled code much faster than it runs the
interpreter.

The second row is not a disappointment, it is the arithmetic: `SIN` and `STR$`
run *the same firmware code* whether your BASIC calls them or the CSUB does, so
only the interpreting overhead goes away. A routine that spends its time inside
the firmware has little for this tool to remove.

### The result runs on every PicoMite

**One converted program runs on both the RP2040 and the RP2350, and on every
firmware variant, unchanged.** You do not build a version per chip, and you do
not have to know what your users have.

That is not a happy accident. The code is compiled for the Cortex-M0+, which
the RP2350 also executes; it is position-independent, so it does not care
where the firmware loads it; and it finds the firmware's routines through a
table it locates *at run time* rather than at an address baked in when it was
built. Nothing in the blob depends on the chip or on the variant.

Tested rather than assumed: the same file — same bytes, same checksum —
produces byte-identical output on a PicoMiteVGA running on an RP2040 and a
PicoMiteHDMIWEB running on an RP2350B, across strings, `STATIC`s, recursion,
`LOCAL` arrays and floating point.

So a converted program can be published, posted on the forum or shipped to
somebody else exactly as an ordinary `.bas` file, and it will work on their
board. The only requirement is the firmware version.

---

## 2. Setting up

`mmb2csub` is a Python program that drives a C compiler. Nothing is installed
and nothing is configured: once the five pieces below are present it works
from wherever you unpacked the firmware source.

### 2.1 What you need

| | |
|---|---|
| **Python 3.6 or later** | 3.8+ recommended |
| **Arm GNU toolchain** | `arm-none-eabi-gcc` — the same compiler that builds the firmware |
| **pyelftools** | a Python package; `armcfgen.py` reads the linked ELF with it |
| **The PicoMite firmware source** | for `PicoCFunctions.h` and `mmcsub.h` |
| **`mmb2c.py`** | the MMBasic-to-C translator |
| **Firmware 6.03.02b9 or later** | on the board itself — see below |

Two things you do **not** need: the Pico SDK, and any ability to build the
firmware. `mmb2csub` compiles a small freestanding blob, not a firmware image.

**The firmware version matters, and nothing on your PC can check it.** A CSUB
reaches the interpreter's own string and maths routines through the CallTable,
and the entries it needs were added in **6.03.02b9**. On the board:

```
? MM.VER
 6.030209
```

6.030209 is b9; anything lower is too old. **6.03.02b10 or later is worth
having** if you expect to put a large CSUB in the library: before b10 that
route cost 3.4x the blob rather than the blob itself, which is the difference
between a 37 KB routine fitting a 100 KB board and not (A.8). Everything else
works on b9.

An older firmware does not refuse the CSUB — the blob is built on your PC and cannot know what it will run on,
so the call goes to a table entry that does not exist yet and the board
crashes or resets with no message. If a CSUB that built cleanly misbehaves
from the very first call, **check this first**.

`pyserial` is needed only if you use `xsend.py` to send programs to the board
(section 7).

### 2.2 Where the pieces have to live

`mmb2csub.py` finds everything relative to itself, so there are no include
paths to set:

```
PicoMite/                     <- the firmware source tree
├── PicoCFunctions.h          <- found automatically
└── user-tools/
    ├── mmb2csub.py           <- you run this
    ├── mmcsub.h              <- found automatically
    └── armcfgen.py           <- called automatically
```

**Keep `mmb2csub.py` inside `user-tools/`.** Copied elsewhere it can no longer
find the header it compiles against.

`mmb2c.py` is the exception. It is a tool in its own right — the same
translator that, converted to C, runs as a native application under the Fuzix
port — so it is kept in one place rather than copied into every project that
uses it. It is looked for in this order:

1. `--mmb2c PATH` on the command line
2. the `MMB2C_PATH` environment variable
3. `mmb2c.py` sitting next to `mmb2csub.py` in `user-tools/`
4. a couple of default locations

If none matches you get a message naming the places it looked. The simplest
answer for most people is (3) — copy `mmb2c.py` into `user-tools/`.

### 2.3 Windows

**Python.** Install from python.org or the Microsoft Store, ticking *Add
Python to PATH*. Check:

```
python --version
```

**The Arm toolchain.** Download the *arm-none-eabi* toolchain from Arm's
Developer site and install it. The installer offers *Add path to environment
variable* — tick it. If you have already built the firmware you have this
already. Check:

```
arm-none-eabi-gcc --version
```

If that says it is not recognised, add the toolchain's `bin` to your PATH. It
is typically:

```
C:\Program Files (x86)\Arm GNU Toolchain arm-none-eabi\<version>\bin
```

**pyelftools:**

```
pip install pyelftools
```

**mmb2c.py.** Copy it into `user-tools\`, or point at it once per session:

```
set MMB2C_PATH=C:\path\to\mmb2c.py
```

To set it permanently, use *Edit environment variables for your account* in
the Start menu.

If you keep it under WSL rather than on Windows, Windows can read it directly
through `\\wsl.localhost\<distro>\home\<you>\...` — no copying needed.

### 2.4 Linux

**Python** is already present on any current distribution. Check it is 3.6 or
later with `python3 --version`. Use `python3` in place of `python` throughout
this manual if your system has no `python`.

**The Arm toolchain and pyelftools**, on Debian/Ubuntu/Raspberry Pi OS:

```
sudo apt install gcc-arm-none-eabi python3-pyelftools
```

On Fedora:

```
sudo dnf install arm-none-eabi-gcc-cs arm-none-eabi-newlib python3-pyelftools
```

On Arch:

```
sudo pacman -S arm-none-eabi-gcc python-pyelftools
```

If your distribution's toolchain is old or missing, Arm's own `.tar.xz` build
works anywhere — unpack it and add its `bin` to your PATH:

```
export PATH=$PATH:/opt/arm-gnu-toolchain-<version>/bin
```

Put that line in `~/.bashrc` to make it permanent.

`pip install pyelftools` also works, but on distributions that manage Python
packages themselves you may need `pip install --user pyelftools` or a virtual
environment.

**mmb2c.py.** Point at wherever you keep it:

```
export MMB2C_PATH=~/src/FUZIX/Applications/mmb2c/mmb2c.py
```

### 2.5 Check it works

This converts nothing and writes nothing — it compiles and links every routine
in a program and reports what it found:

```
python mmb2csub.py yourprogram.bas --list
```

A listing means the whole chain works: Python found `mmb2c.py`, translated
your program, called the compiler, and linked the result.

### 2.6 If it does not

| message | cause |
|---|---|
| `cannot find mmb2c.py` | see 2.2 — the message names every place it looked |
| `arm-none-eabi-gcc: not found`, or `is not recognized` | the toolchain is not on your PATH |
| `No module named 'elftools'` | `pip install pyelftools` |
| `mmcsub.h: No such file` | `mmb2csub.py` has been moved out of `user-tools/` |
| `No module named 'serial'` | only `xsend.py` needs this: `pip install pyserial` |

A failure here is always one of these five. Once `--list` produces a listing
the environment is finished with, and every later problem is about your
program rather than your setup.

---

## 3. The recommended workflow

### Step 1 — make sure there is a routine to convert

This tool converts a SUB or a FUNCTION. If your hot code is not in one, the
first job is to put it in one, and **how you draw that boundary decides how
well the conversion goes** — more than anything else you do later.

The Julia set example began as inline code at the top of the program:

```basic
For y = 0 To 239
  For x = 0 To 319
    ' ... the escape-time loop ...
  Next x
Next y
```

Nothing there can be converted. Wrapped as a routine, all of it can:

```basic
Sub PlotJulia(w%, h%, cx!, cy!, maxiter%)
  Local x%, y%
  For y% = 0 To h% - 1
    For x% = 0 To w% - 1
      ' ... the escape-time loop ...
    Next x%
  Next y%
End Sub
```

**Four rules for drawing the boundary.** They are the same rules, really:
give the routine what it needs and let it get on with it.

**Wrap the outermost loop, not the innermost.** A CSUB is one call, and the
whole benefit is the interpreter not reading your code a million times. Put
the boundary outside every loop you can, so one call does all the work. A
routine called from inside a hot loop saves you almost nothing, because the
interpreter is still running the loop.

**Pass what it needs as parameters, not as globals.** The routine above takes
its width, height and constants as arguments; it would have worked equally
well reading them from globals, and converted far less comfortably. Every
global a routine reaches costs an argument and makes the wrapper bigger, and
past ten they have to be gathered into a table. Parameters are free.

**Move the variables it only uses itself to `LOCAL`.** A variable that lives
in the routine is compiled into the blob and costs nothing. The same variable
left global is one more argument, one more line of wrapper, and one more thing
that can go wrong. If a loop counter is global because the code used to be
inline, make it `LOCAL` on the way in.

**Keep the display and file work outside if you can.** A routine that spends
its time in `PRINT` or `SAVE IMAGE` is running firmware code either way, so
there is nothing for the tool to remove — see the table in section 1. Compute
in the routine, report outside it.

None of this is wasted effort if the conversion does not work out, because
it is the same shape that makes a program readable: a routine with a clear
boundary, taking what it needs and owning its own variables.

Two things that are worth knowing before you carve:

- If the code uses a global that nothing ever `DIM`s — common in older
  programs, where a variable springs into being on first assignment — declare
  it at program level while you are there. A.7 explains why this one bites
  only after conversion.
- A `FUNCTION` is as convertible as a `SUB`, numeric or string. You do not
  have to reshape one into the other.

### Step 2 — find out where the time goes

Run your program with profiling on. You are looking for the routine with the
most **self time**, not the most calls: a routine called 1,500 times that does
nothing much matters less than one called 500 times that does everything.

If your profile only gives call counts, treat them as a hint and use step 3 to
check the shape of the call graph before deciding.

### Step 3 — ask what can be converted, and what it costs

```
python mmb2csub.py myprogram.bas --list
```

This changes nothing. It compiles and links every routine in the program, so
the answer is the toolchain's, not a guess. It takes a minute or two on a large
program.

```
Convertible, and not already inside another one's blob:
  routine          args     blob    prog closure  also brings in
  DrawFrame           6     4280     14k       3  Rotate, Project, Clip
  Julia              10     1136      3k       1  -

Also convertible, and worth having if a root above is out of reach:
  routine          args     blob    prog closure  carried by
  Rotate              4      980      3k       1  DrawFrame

Not convertible:
  AskUser        needs mm_input_line, mm_input_next
  Report         parameter 'pt' is a user TYPE
```

The four numbers are the whole decision:

- **args** — how many arguments the CSUB will take. Your parameters, plus one
  for every global the routine reaches. Past ten, the globals stop being
  separate arguments and travel as a single array of their addresses, so a
  routine reaching twenty of them still takes only a handful.
- **blob** — the machine code.
- **prog** — what it costs in **program memory**, which is what actually has
  to fit. A CSUB is stored as hex text *and* as the binary built from it, so
  this is about 3.4x the blob. Compare it with the `Free` figure from
  `MEMORY` on the board.
- **closure** — how many routines travel with it.

### Step 4 — pick ONE routine, as high up as fits

This is the step people get wrong. **You do not pick a list of hot routines —
you pick one root, and everything it calls comes with it.** The first section
of the listing is exactly the routines that are not already inside somebody
else's blob.

Converting two routines from the same call tree gives you two CSUBs each
carrying its own copy of the shared code. The tool will say so:

```
note: DrawFrame already carries Rotate - converting both duplicates it
```

If the root you want is out of reach — too many arguments, or more program
memory than you have — drop to the largest routine below it that fits. That is
what the second section of the listing is for.

### Step 5 — convert it, keeping everything, and check it works

```
python mmb2csub.py myprogram.bas DrawFrame
```

The default keeps the original routine commented out and the generated C as
comments, so you can read what happened. Your previous version is saved as
`myprogram.bas.bak` regardless.

Load it and run it. If it works, go on. If it does not, `--dry-run` builds and
reports without touching your source, and `--keep-c` leaves the C on disk.

### Step 6 — if it does not fit, make it lean

The comments cost program memory — the interpreter stores the text.

```
python mmb2csub.py myprogram.bas DrawFrame --lean
```

`--lean` drops the commented-out original, the embedded C, and the CSUB's own
internal comments, and refills the hex eight words to a line. For a small
program that is the difference between 7.9 KB of program text and 4.5 KB.
Nothing is lost: the `.bak` has the original and the C regenerates.

`--no-c` and `--no-original` do one each if you want to keep the other.

If it still does not fit, put the CSUB in the **library**, which is what
`--library` is for:

```
python mmb2csub.py myprogram.bas DrawFrame --library mylib.bas --lean
```

The CSUBs and their wrappers go to `mylib.bas` instead of into your program,
and your program keeps only the originals, commented out. A bare filename like
that one is written **beside your program**, not into whatever directory you
happened to run the tool from; give a path if you want it somewhere else. The
tool prints where it went. Then, on the board:

```
LIBRARY LOAD "mylib.bas"
LOAD "myprogram.bas"
RUN
```

The library holds the binary alone, so the program is left with almost all of
program memory to itself. `--lean` applies to the library file — there is
nothing in your program to make lean. Several routines named in one command
all go into the same library file.

`LIBRARY LOAD` reads the file straight into the library, converting the hex to
binary as it goes, so what it costs is the blob and nothing more. A program can
do it for itself, as its first statement:

```basic
LIBRARY LOAD "mylib.bas", O
```

It installs the library and restarts the program, and on every later run it
sees the library is already the right one and does nothing — so this is a
reasonable thing to leave in a program you give somebody.

### Step 7 — prove it gives the same answer

This is not optional. A CSUB that is subtly wrong does not print a helpful
message; it hard-faults with no line number, or quietly returns a different
number.

- **If it draws**, `SAVE IMAGE` before and after and compare the files. The
  comparison can be done on the board — see `Bas/filecmp.bas`.
- **If it computes**, print the results both ways over the same inputs and diff
  them. Keep the `.bak`, which still has the interpreted version.
- **Then** time it.

Do the correctness check before the timing. A fast wrong answer is not progress.

## 4. What can be converted

**Yes:** SUBs and FUNCTIONs, numeric or string; numeric and string scalars,
and numeric arrays, as parameters or globals; `LOCAL`s including arrays and
strings; `STATIC`s, which the wrapper keeps for you; recursion; `IF`/`FOR`/`DO`/`WHILE`/`SELECT`/`EXIT`; all arithmetic and comparison;
`CONST`; and the MMBasic functions with firmware support — `SIN COS TAN LOG SQR
ATAN2 ASIN ACOS POWER INT FIX ABS SGN RND TIMER`, `LEFT$ RIGHT$ MID$ UCASE$
LCASE$ CHR$ SPACE$ STRING$ INSTR STR$ VAL LEN ASC`, `RGB` (including the
colour names), `MM.HRES` and `MM.VRES`, `PRINT`, and the drawing statements
`PIXEL`, `LINE`, `BOX`, `CIRCLE` and `TRIANGLE`; and `PIN(n)` and `PIN(n) = v`
for reading and driving a pin.

`RGB` costs nothing at all: the translator works it out where it stands, so
`RGB(red)` becomes a constant and `RGB(r, g, b)` becomes the shift-and-or it
always was. The drawing statements call the same firmware routines the
interpreter calls, so what you get on screen is identical — a converted
routine and the original produce the same image byte for byte.

`PIN` is worth a word. Setting a pin up — `SETPIN`, `OPTION` — stays in BASIC,
where it happens once; what converts is the reading and writing, which is the
part that goes in a loop. It reads whatever the pin's mode means, through the
interpreter's own routine, so a CSUB and `PIN(n)` cannot disagree. Needs
firmware 6.03.02b10.

Which modes that covers, for `PIN(n)`:

| `SETPIN` mode | `PIN(n)` gives you |
|---|---|
| `DIN`, `INTH`, `INTL`, `INTB` | 0 or 1 |
| `DOUT`, and a PIO output | the level the pin is driving |
| `CIN` | the count |
| `FIN`, `PIN` | frequency, period — the pin must be one of the four `INT` pins |
| `AIN` | volts, filtered exactly as the interpreter filters them |
| `AINRAW` | the raw count, 0 to 4095 |

and for `PIN(n) = v`: a pin set `DOUT`, a pin not configured at all (which
becomes an output, as in BASIC), and `CIN`, where the write sets the counter
rather than the pin.

Anything else — a pin assigned to a UART, SPI, I2C, PWM or an `INT`, a
heartbeat, a pin number that does not exist on the board — is where the
difference from BASIC shows. A CSUB cannot raise an error, because the error
would longjmp out of the middle of it, so instead a read gives 0 and a write
does nothing. Check the mode in BASIC before you call, or read
`ExtCurrentConfig[]` from the CSUB if you want to branch on it.

`PIN(TEMP)` and `PIN(BOOTSEL)` do not convert. They are keywords rather than
pin numbers and the firmware handles them before any pin exists; leave them in
BASIC.

**Not yet:** string *arrays* as parameters; `INPUT`; `ON ERROR`; interrupt
handlers; file I/O; user-defined `TYPE`s; `MAP`; `SETPIN`; and the graphics
beyond the list above — `RBOX`, `POLYGON`, sprites, framebuffers, and a `LINE` with a
width, which is four different algorithms in the firmware and has no
CallTable slot of its own.

If what you need is in that second list, or is something MMBasic cannot
express at all, a **hand-written CSUB** can still do it — that is a different
job and has its own manual, `docs/armcfgen.md`, whose Appendix A lists every
firmware routine a CSUB can call. The two tools produce the same kind of
`CSUB ... END CSUB` block and can be mixed freely in one program.

String work inside a CSUB runs on the firmware's own string routines — the same
code `MID$` uses when your BASIC calls it — so a string-heavy routine gains what
the interpreting overhead was costing and no more. See the table in section 1.

You do not have to memorise that list. **Anything unsupported is refused**, by
name, before anything is written — either by the tool or by the C compiler,
which is the real scope check. The tool will not produce a CSUB it cannot
account for.

**Appendix A** explains where each restriction comes from, and covers two
things this list cannot: what a CSUB does *instead* of stopping with an error,
and what is deliberately not a limitation.

---

## 5. The limits, and what to do about them

**Arguments.** `MAX_CSUB_ARGS` is 16 on RP2350 and 10 on RP2040, and that
counts your parameters plus the globals the routine reaches. Past ten globals
the tool gathers them into one array of addresses instead, which lifts the
limit for practical purposes — the wrapper fills it with `PEEK(VARADDR x)`,
which is the same call the interpreter makes to build an argument pointer.
It costs a little wrapper text and nothing at run time.

**Program memory.** `text` in the listing, against what `MM.INFO(PROGRAM SIZE)`
tells you is free. Remedies, in order: `--lean`, then crunching the rest of the
program (`XMODEM C`, `AUTOSAVE C`, `LOAD ,C`), then `LIBRARY SAVE`.

**Self-contained is best.** A routine that only touches its parameters converts
cleanly and cheaply. Every global it reaches costs an argument and makes the
wrapper bigger.

**Interrupting it.** The interpreter tests the break key between statements, and
your converted routine is now *one* statement. The tool puts a break check
inside every loop so `Ctrl-C` still works; without that a long CSUB makes the
board stop answering.

**No range checks, no clean stop.** A CSUB cannot reach the interpreter's
error handling, so an out-of-range subscript writes to memory instead of
reporting `Index out of bounds`. Convert code that already works. Appendix
A.2 has the detail.

---

## 6. Options

| | |
|---|---|
| `--list` | report what can be converted and what it costs; change nothing |
| `--dry-run` | build and report, leave the source alone |
| `--library FILE` | write the CSUBs and wrappers to FILE, for `LIBRARY SAVE`. A bare filename goes beside your program; give a path to put it elsewhere |
| `--lean` | keep nothing but the CSUB (with `--library`, applies to FILE) |
| `--no-c` | do not keep the generated C as comments |
| `--no-original` | delete the original routine rather than commenting it out |
| `--keep-c` | also leave the generated `.c` on disk |
| `--no-backup` | do not write `<source>.bak` |
| `--name NAME` | name the CSUB yourself |
| `-O LEVEL` | optimisation level (default `s`; prefer it for anything large) |

When nothing needs wrapping, the CSUB **takes the original routine's name** and
your call sites go straight to it. A wrapper appears only when something must be
marshalled — a FUNCTION's result, an array's `BOUND()`, or globals — and then
the wrapper carries the original name instead.

---

## 7. Getting the program onto the board

`user-tools/xsend.py` sends a program by XMODEM straight into program memory:

```
python xsend.py COM7 myprogram.bas
python xsend.py COM7 myprogram.bas --crunch    # strip comments on the way in
```

Four seconds rather than a minute for a large program — and, more importantly,
**it is acknowledged**. Pasting a program at the prompt can fail silently and
leave the *previous* program running, which looks exactly like a successful run
of the new one. If you benchmark that, you benchmark the old code.

---

## 8. When something goes wrong

**`undefined reference to mm_xxx`** — that MMBasic feature has no CSUB runtime
yet. The name tells you which: `mm_input_next` is `INPUT`, `mm_map_get` is
`MAP()`. Take it out of the routine, or convert a different one.

**`undefined reference to __aeabi_xxx`** — an arithmetic helper is missing from
`mmcsub.h`. This one is a gap in the tool; report it rather than working around
it.

**`would need N arguments`** — see the limits above.

**`X calls Y ...` / `X is a string FUNCTION`** — the closure includes a routine
that cannot be converted. The message names the real culprit, which is often not
the routine you asked for.

**It built, but the board crashes or resets on the first call** — check the
firmware version before anything else: `? MM.VER` must be 6.030209 (b9) or
higher. See section 2.1. Nothing on your PC can detect this, because the blob
is built without knowing what it will run on.

**It compiled but the answer is wrong** — go back to step 7 and find the
smallest input that differs. The `.bak` has the interpreted original, so you can
run both. Please report it: the generated C is meant to be a faithful
translation, and a difference is a bug in the tool, not in your program.

---

## 9. A worked example, and an honest one

`solar_eclipse.bas` — 3,200 lines, 33 routines — profiles like this: `findleap`
1,455 calls, `utc2tdb` 1,455, `jdfunc` 1,454, `nut2000_lp` 954, then a dozen
routines around 480, and `sefunc` at 474.

The call-count ordering suggests converting `findleap`. The listing says
otherwise: `findleap` is *inside* `sefunc`'s blob, and converting `sefunc`
covers 15 of the 20 profiled routines and 99.8% of the calls.

`sefunc` reaches **twenty globals**, which used to put it out of reach on
argument count alone. It no longer does — they travel as one array, so the CSUB
takes three arguments: `x!`, `fx!` and the table. It converts, and the blob is
correct. What stops it is size, in a way worth following through because it is
the case `--library` was added for.

Its blob is 37 KB. In the program that is about 89 KB of text, which does not
fit — so it goes to a library instead:

```
python mmb2csub.py solar_eclipse.bas sefunc --library sefunc.bas --lean
```

and on the board, `LIBRARY LOAD "sefunc.bas"`. That makes a 37 KB library
entry and leaves the whole of program memory for the program, on **either**
board. The result:

| | interpreted | with `sefunc` in the library |
|---|---|---|
| RP2350B at 252 MHz | 13 s | **2.7 s** |
| RP2350B at 378 MHz | | **2.48 s** |
| RP2040 (PicoMiteVGA) | | **5.7 s** |

One conversion, covering 15 of the 20 profiled routines and 99.8% of the
calls, and the answers are identical on both boards to the last digit.

Note how little the clock speed matters once the routine is converted: half
again as much CPU buys under 10%. Before the conversion the program was
waiting on the interpreter, and that is what has gone.

One thing has to be done first, and it is the trap A.7 describes. The globals
`sefunc` reaches must exist before the wrapper can take their addresses, so the
five this program never declares need a `Dim` at program level.

**On firmware older than 6.03.02b10** the library route cost 3.4x the blob and
`sefunc` would not go onto a 100 KB board at all (A.8). The answer there is
several smaller conversions from the second listing: `tdb2utc` has a 3.5 KB
blob and carries `jbrent`, `jdfunc`, `utc2tdb` and `findleap` — between them
nearly 5,000 calls; `gast2` carries `nut2000_lp`; `eci2topo` carries six more.
Choose them so their closures do not overlap and put them all in one library
file with a single command.

Two things to take from that. The listing, not the profile, tells you what to
convert. And when a routine is out of reach it is now nearly always about size
rather than shape — which is a question of where you put the blob, not whether
the tool can build it.

## Appendix A — Limitations, and where they come from

Section 4 lists what converts and section 5 the practical limits. This
appendix explains *why*, because the reasons are more useful than the list:
almost every restriction below follows from one of four facts about what a
CSUB is, and once you know those four you can usually predict the answer
without looking anything up.

**The four facts.**

1. To the interpreter, a CSUB is **one statement**.
2. The blob is **code and constants only** — it has no writable data.
3. It links **without a C library**.
4. It has **no path back** to the interpreter's error handling.

---

### A.1 No writable data

The firmware loads the blob at an address of its choosing and gives it no
data segment. There is nowhere to put a variable that outlives a call.

**`STATIC` still works**, but not by living in the CSUB. The wrapper declares
an MMBasic `STATIC` of its own and passes its address in, which gives exactly
the lifetime the original had — one instance, initialised on the first call,
surviving every later one. Array bounds and initialisers are copied from your
declaration, so this:

```basic
Static hits%, acc! = 1.5
Static tab%(4)
```

becomes a wrapper holding the same three variables and passing all three. The
cost is one argument each, against the ceiling in A.5.

**What you cannot do** is keep state anywhere else. There is no equivalent of
a C `static` inside the routine, and the 256 bytes of `CFuncRam` that a CSUB
does own are already spoken for by the string scratch stack and the globals
table.

You will not hit this by accident. Since 6.03.02b9 the linker checks it:

```
this CSUB has writable static data (.bss); a CSUB has no data segment
```

That check exists because the failure it prevents is silent. The C is valid,
the compile is clean, the blob builds and runs — and every access goes to
memory belonging to something else. It is worth knowing about if you also
write CSUBs by hand, because it applies to those identically.

---

### A.2 No error path

`error()` in the firmware does a `longjmp`. A CSUB cannot call it: the jump
would abandon the CSUB's own stack frame. So a CSUB has no way to stop with a
message, and that has three consequences worth taking seriously.

**`ON ERROR` is refused.** Nothing to add — the tool tells you.

**Array subscripts are not checked.** This is the one that catches people.
MMBasic checks every subscript and stops with `Index out of bounds`. The
generated C does not check at all:

```c
__L->v_s[(int)(v_k)] = v_k;     /* no range test, by design */
```

A subscript one past the end writes to whatever is next in memory. In the
interpreted version that same line gives you a clean error and a line number.
**Convert code that is already correct**, and do not use a CSUB to find bugs.

**Stack overflow resets the board.** Recursion is supported and works, but
without the interpreter's depth check. A recursive routine with a `LOCAL`
array was measured both ways: MMBasic stopped it cleanly at depth 9 with
`Stack overflow, at depth 9`, while the converted CSUB ran past depth 100 and
reset the board somewhere before 150, with no message. Deep or unbounded
recursion is the wrong thing to convert.

**Arguments are not range-checked either.** `RGB(r, g, b)` is the one you
are most likely to meet: MMBasic rejects a component outside 0 to 255 with an
error, while the converted code simply keeps the low eight bits, so an
out-of-range value silently becomes a different colour. This only bites code
that was already erroring in the interpreter, which is the general shape of
the problem — convert code that works.

The general rule: a CSUB fails the way C fails, not the way BASIC fails.

---

### A.3 One statement

The interpreter checks the break key *between* statements, and your routine is
now a single statement. The tool puts a break check inside every loop, so
`Ctrl-C` still works — without it a long CSUB makes the board stop answering.
The check costs a counter increment per iteration and fires once every 1024.

Two smaller consequences: a profiler cannot see inside a CSUB, so convert
before you profile again rather than after; and a run-time fault has no line
number to report, which is the other half of A.2.

---

### A.4 No C library

Everything routes to the firmware's own routines through the CallTable, so
there is no second copy of soft-float or string code in the blob. When
something has no route, you get a link error naming it:

- **`undefined reference to mm_xxx`** — an MMBasic feature with no CSUB
  runtime yet. The name says which: `mm_input_next` is `INPUT`, `mm_fb_copy`
  is the framebuffer.
- **`undefined reference to __aeabi_xxx`** — an arithmetic helper is missing.
  That one is a gap in the tool rather than in your program; please report it.

This is why the tool can be trusted not to produce a CSUB it cannot account
for: the compiler and linker are the scope check, so the supported list cannot
quietly drift out of date.

---

### A.5 The argument ceiling

`MAX_CSUB_ARGS` is **16 on RP2350 and 10 on RP2040**, counting your
parameters, one per global the routine reaches, and one per `STATIC`.

Past ten globals the tool stops passing them separately and gathers them into
a single array of addresses, which lifts the limit for practical purposes. The
wrapper fills it with `PEEK(VARADDR x)` — the same call the interpreter makes
to build an argument pointer — so it costs a little wrapper text and nothing
at run time.

A routine reaching twenty globals is still usually the wrong thing to convert,
for the reason in section 9: it is a sign the work is spread across the
program rather than contained in the routine.

---

### A.6 Strings

String work runs on the firmware's own routines — the same code `MID$` uses
when your BASIC calls it — so results are identical and the gain is only the
interpreting overhead. Three limits:

**A statement's temporaries are bounded.** String expressions build
temporaries in a 4 KB scratch arena, about sixteen full-length strings, thrown
away at the end of each statement. A single statement that builds more than
that wraps round and reuses the space rather than overrunning it, which would
corrupt that statement's own earlier temporaries. Splitting a monster
concatenation across several statements is the fix; in practice this is very
hard to reach.

**String arrays cannot be parameters.** A string array's element stride
follows the `LENGTH` it was declared with, and the CSUB is never told what
that is, so indexing one would be wrong *silently*. Refused for that reason.
Scalar string parameters are fine — they are already exactly what the ABI
passes. The same applies to a `STATIC` string array.

**`LENGTH` on a simple string variable is ignored** by MMBasic itself, which
always gives those 256 bytes — so nothing is lost in translation there.

---

### A.7 Globals the program never declares

A wrapper reaches a global with `PEEK(VARADDR x)`, which needs the variable to
**already exist**. Without `OPTION EXPLICIT`, MMBasic creates a global the
first time something assigns to it — so a global that only ever came into
being inside the routine you are converting will no longer be created by
anything, and the wrapper stops with:

```
Error : Cannot find DECL
```

The fix is one line at program level, naming the variables the message
complains about:

```basic
Dim decl, rasc, rb, rlsun, rmm
```

This is worth checking before you convert rather than after. `solar_eclipse`
has five such globals out of the twenty `sefunc` reaches: they are assigned
inside `sun` and never declared anywhere, so they exist only because `sun`
has run. Programs written with `OPTION EXPLICIT` cannot have the problem.

---

### A.8 Program memory

A CSUB costs program memory **twice**: once as the hex text of the
`CSUB ... END CSUB` block, and again as the binary the interpreter builds from
that text. The board shows them on separate lines:

```
Program:
   9K ( 8%) Program (126 lines)     <- the hex text, about 2.4x the blob
   3K ( 2%) 1 Embedded C Routine    <- the binary,   about 1x
  88K (90%) Free
```

So budget about **3.4x the blob size**, which is what the `prog` column of
`--list` reports.

**A missing `Embedded C Routine` line is the tell** that a CSUB's code did not
make it. The program still lists and the CSUB still appears, because the text
fit; only the binary was dropped. Calling it then gives
`Error : Internal fault 5(sorry)`.

In order of what to try: `--lean`, then crunching the rest of the program
(`XMODEM C`, `AUTOSAVE C`, `LOAD ,C`), then `--library` and `LIBRARY LOAD`,
which puts the blob in the library and leaves the program almost all of
program memory.

**The library costs the blob and nothing more.** `LIBRARY LOAD "file.bas"`
reads the file itself, converting each CSUB's hex to binary as it streams
past, and never stores the hex text at all. So the limit is simply the library
area — a slot the size of program memory, 100 KB on an RP2040 and 144 KB on an
RP2350 — against the blob alone, not against 3.4x of it.

`solar_eclipse` is the case that makes the difference plain: its 37 KB
`sefunc` becomes a 37 KB library entry and loads on either board (section 9).

**Older firmware is the thing to watch.** Before 6.03.02b10 the only route was
`LIBRARY SAVE`, which takes the CSUB out of *program* memory — so the library
file had to load there first, costing its hex text **and** the binary at once,
about 3.4x the blob. That put the ceiling near a 29 KB blob on an RP2040. Past
it the failure was quiet and is worth recognising if you meet it on an older
board: the load stops early with no `Saved nnn bytes`, the save reports a byte
count far smaller than the blob, `LIBRARY LIST` still shows the CSUB because
its *declaration* fitted, and calling it gives `Error : Internal fault
5(sorry)`.

---

### A.9 What is not translated at all

As of 6.03.02b9, 132 of the 166 routines in the test corpus convert. What the
remaining 34 are waiting on, largest group first:

| | |
|---|---|
| interrupt handlers (`SETTICK`, `ON KEY`, pin interrupts) | a CSUB cannot be one |
| user-defined `TYPE`s, as parameters or locals | not yet translated |
| `INPUT` | no CSUB runtime yet |
| graphics beyond `PIXEL`, framebuffers, file I/O | no CSUB runtime yet |
| `DIM` of a `LOCAL` array at run time | needs a heap the blob does not have |
| routine names containing dots | a tool bug, not a limitation |

You do not have to memorise any of it. Everything unsupported is refused by
name before anything is written, so the failure mode is a message rather than
a surprise.

---

### A.10 What is *not* a limitation

Worth stating, because it saves chasing imagined problems:

- **Arithmetic is identical.** Integer and floating-point operations, and
  every maths function, call the same firmware routines the interpreter calls.
  There is no reduced-precision path and no second implementation.
- **String functions are identical**, for the same reason.
- **Recursion works**, within A.2's caveat about depth.
- **`LOCAL` arrays and strings work**, including in recursive routines, each
  call getting its own.
- **Call sites do not change.** The CSUB takes the routine's name, or a
  wrapper does when something has to be marshalled.
- **One blob runs everywhere.** RP2040 and RP2350, every firmware variant, no
  per-chip build — see the end of section 1. A converted program is as
  portable as the BASIC it came from.

So if a converted routine gives a different answer from the interpreted one,
that is a **bug in the tool**, not a rounding difference or a documented
limit. The `.bak` still has the original; please report the smallest input
that differs.
