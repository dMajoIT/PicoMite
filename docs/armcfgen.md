# PicoMite CSUBs — Writing Them and Building Them with armcfgen.py

This manual is in three parts:

1. **Writing a CSUB** — what a CSUB is, exactly how BASIC passes arguments to it
   (integers, floats, strings, arrays and string arrays), the rules you must
   follow, and worked examples in both *merge* and *join* form.
2. **Building a CSUB** — turning your C into a pasteable `CSUB … END CSUB` block
   with `armcfgen.py`.
3. **Appendix A — The CallTable** — every firmware routine a CSUB can call.

If you would rather not write C at all, `mmb2csub.py` converts an MMBasic
SUB or FUNCTION into a CSUB for you, using these same CallTable routines —
see `docs/mmb2csub.md`. This manual is the one to read when you want control
over the C, or when what you need is not something MMBasic can express.

# Part 1 — Writing a CSUB

## 1.1 What a CSUB is

A **CSUB** is a block of compiled machine code embedded directly in a BASIC
program as hexadecimal words:

```
CSUB myfunc INTEGER
  00000000
  B5704B08 0004681B 68006841 ...
END CSUB
```

When BASIC executes `myfunc x`, the interpreter jumps straight into that machine
code. A CSUB therefore lets you write performance‑critical or hardware‑level
work in C (or assembler) and call it from BASIC like any other subroutine.

Three consequences follow from "it's just embedded machine code", and they shape
everything else in this manual:

* **There is no linker.** A CSUB cannot call firmware functions or C library
  functions by name. The *only* way it reaches anything in the firmware is
  through the **CallTable** — a table of function pointers the firmware exposes
  (see §1.5 and Appendix A).
* **It must be self‑contained and position independent.** The blob is pasted
  into flash wherever your program happens to live, so it can't depend on a fixed
  load address — the firmware does no relocation. The build handles this for you,
  including read‑only data (see §1.4).
* **It targets Cortex‑M0+.** Code built for the M0+ instruction set runs
  unchanged on both the RP2040 (M0+) and the RP2350 (M33), so one blob works on
  every PicoMite board.

A CSUB is a *subroutine*: it returns nothing usable to BASIC (its C return value
is ignored). It communicates results by **writing back through its arguments**.
(A `CFUNCTION` is the value‑returning sibling; this manual concentrates on CSUBs,
but the argument rules are identical.)

## 1.2 How arguments are passed — the golden rule

> **Every argument is passed to the CSUB as a pointer.**

BASIC never passes a value in a register — it passes the *address* of the
argument's storage. Your C function therefore always receives pointers, one per
BASIC argument, in order:

```c
long long myfunc(long long *a, double *b, unsigned char *c)
/*                 ^ INTEGER     ^ FLOAT     ^ STRING            */
```

Because you get the address of the caller's storage, **writing through the
pointer changes the BASIC variable in place** — that is how a CSUB returns
results. The C return type is always `long long` and is ignored.

Two limits: a CSUB may take at most **10** arguments, and array **bounds are not
passed** (see §1.3.4).

### 1.2.1 Variables vs expressions

The in‑place behaviour only works when the caller passes a **variable**:

```basic
myfunc x          ' x is a variable -> CSUB gets &x, can change it
myfunc 5          ' 5 is an expression -> CSUB gets a pointer to a throwaway
myfunc a+b        '   temporary; any change is lost
```

Always pass a variable for anything the CSUB writes to.

## 1.3 The five kinds of argument

### 1.3.1 Integers

A BASIC integer is a **64‑bit signed** value. You receive a pointer to it:

```c
long long myfunc(long long *a)
{
    *a = *a * 2;        /* doubles the caller's integer */
    return 0;
}
```
```basic
x% = 21 : myfunc x% : Print x%      ' 42
```

> Note: 64‑bit **add/subtract** compile inline, but 64‑bit **multiply/divide**
> need a helper that isn't in the blob (see §1.4). For `*a * 2` GCC uses a shift,
> so it's fine; a general 64×64 multiply is not.

### 1.3.2 Floats

A BASIC float is a **C `double`** (64‑bit). You receive a pointer to it:

```c
long long myfunc(double *a)
{
    *a = FMul(*a, *a);   /* squares it - note FMul, NOT *  (see §1.4) */
    return 0;
}
```

### 1.3.3 Strings

A BASIC string is **not** a C string. It is a **length‑prefixed** buffer:

```
byte 0      : length (0–255)
bytes 1..N  : the characters (NOT null‑terminated)
```

You receive a pointer to byte 0:

```c
long long supper(unsigned char *s)   /* uppercase a string in place */
{
    int n = s[0];                    /* byte 0 is the length        */
    for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++)     /* characters are s[1]..s[n]   */
        if (s[i] >= 'a' && s[i] <= 'z') s[i] -= 32;
    return 0;
}
```
```basic
a$ = "hello" : supper a$ : Print a$     ' HELLO
```

To **return** a string, set the length byte and write the characters:

```c
s[0] = 3; s[1] = 'a'; s[2] = 'b'; s[3] = 'c';   /* s$ becomes "abc" */
```

Maximum length is 255. If you want a normal null‑terminated C string to work
with, you must convert it yourself (read `s[0]`, copy `s[1..n]`, append `\0`);
the firmware's internal `CtoM`/`MtoC` helpers are not in the CallTable.

### 1.3.4 Numeric arrays

An array argument (written `a()` in the call) passes a pointer to the array's
**contiguous data** — `long long *` for an integer array, `double *` for a float
array:

```c
long long isum(long long *a, long long *n, long long *result)
{
    long long s = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < (int)*n; i++) s += a[i];
    *result = s;
    return 0;
}
```
```basic
Dim Integer v(4) = (10,20,30,40,50)
Dim Integer total
isum v(), 5, total
Print total            ' 150
```

> **Array bounds are not passed.** The CSUB has no idea how big `a()` is, so pass
> the element count as a separate argument (as `n` above) — or agree on a fixed
> size. Reading past the end corrupts memory.

You can also pass a single element (`a(3)`), which gives a pointer to that one
element's storage.

### 1.3.5 String arrays

A string array passes a pointer to the **first element**. The elements are laid
out back‑to‑back, each one a length‑prefixed string of fixed width:

```
stride = (declared LENGTH) + 1     bytes per element
       = 256 by default            (LENGTH defaults to 255)
element e starts at  base + e * stride
```

So the CSUB needs both the **element count** and the **stride** (i.e. the
`LENGTH`) to walk the array:

```c
long long aupper(unsigned char *s, long long *nn, long long *len)
{
    int n = (int)*nn, stride = (int)*len + 1;   /* LENGTH + 1 */
    for (int e = 0; e < n; e++) {
        unsigned char *el = s + e * stride;     /* this element */
        int L = el[0];                          /* its length byte */
        for (int i = 1; i <= L; i++)
            if (el[i] >= 'a' && el[i] <= 'z') el[i] -= 32;
    }
    return 0;
}
```
```basic
Dim s$(2) Length 16 = ("one","two","three")
aupper s$(), 3, 16
Print s$(0), s$(1), s$(2)      ' ONE TWO THREE
```

Pass the same `LENGTH` you declared the array with; if you used the default,
the stride is 256.

### 1.3.6 Summary

| BASIC argument | C parameter | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| integer `x%` | `long long *` | 64‑bit; write back to modify |
| float `x!` | `double *` | C `double`; do maths via CallTable (§1.4) |
| string `s$` | `unsigned char *` | length‑prefixed: `s[0]`=len, `s[1..]`=chars, max 255 |
| integer array `a()` | `long long *` | contiguous; bounds **not** passed |
| float array `a()` | `double *` | contiguous; bounds **not** passed |
| string array `s$()` | `unsigned char *` | stride = `LENGTH`+1 (default 256); each element length‑prefixed |
| single element `a(i)` | pointer to that element | |
| expression `a+b`, literal | pointer to a temporary | read‑only in effect |

## 1.4 The rules you must follow

These are not style preferences — break them and the blob crashes or won't build.

1. **No floating‑point or 64‑bit multiply/divide/variable‑shift C operators.**
   Cortex‑M0+ has no FPU, no 64‑bit multiply and no divide, and the blob links
   without libgcc — so those operators make the compiler emit a helper
   (`__aeabi_dadd`, `__aeabi_dmul`, `__aeabi_lmul`, `__aeabi_ldivmod`,
   `__aeabi_llsl`, …) that is **not in the blob**. Do that maths by calling the
   firmware instead (§1.5).

   For `double`, **every** operator needs a firmware call. For `long long`, only
   five do — `*`, `/`, `%`, and `<<`/`>>` by a **variable** count. Add, subtract,
   negate, compare, `&`/`|`/`^`/`~` and shifts by a **constant** all compile
   inline and are fine as written, as is all 32‑bit integer maths.

   From firmware 6.03.02b8 the five have CallTable slots of their own — `LMul`,
   `LDiv`, `LMod`, `LShl`, `LAsr`, `LLsr` (§1.5) — so 64‑bit maths no longer
   means dropping to 32 bits. Note `LAsr` is the *arithmetic* right shift (sign
   propagating) and `LLsr` the *logical* one; MMBasic's own `>>` operator is
   logical, so `LLsr` is the one that matches it.

   *Safety net:* if you slip up, the build fails with `undefined reference to
   __aeabi_…` rather than producing a broken blob.

   **`memcpy`/`memset`/`memmove` are a special case.** The compiler emits calls
   to these *by name*, without you writing one — `char buf[64] = {0}`, a struct
   assignment or an array copy all become one — so a CallTable macro cannot
   catch them and the symbols themselves have to be in the blob. Put
   `#define CSUB_MEM_SHIMS` before `#include "PicoCFunctions.h"` and you get
   shims that forward to the firmware's own routines, 20 bytes each. Leave it
   undefined and you save the space, at the price of an `undefined reference to
   memset` if the compiler wants one.
   `switch` statements are fine: the tool compiles with `-fno-jump-tables`, so a
   `switch` (or an if‑chain the optimiser would turn into one) becomes compares and
   branches rather than a jump table through a libgcc helper
   (`__gnu_thumb1_case_*`) that is not in the blob either.
2. **Constant data (`.rodata`) is fine.** `const` tables, strings and `double`
   literals work: the tool compiles position‑independent (text‑relative) code and
   appends the rodata to the blob, reached PC‑relative — so it runs wherever it
   lands in flash, with no firmware relocation. (Passing values in through an
   argument array is still slightly leaner when you have the choice.)
3. **Pass a variable, not an expression**, for anything you write back (§1.2.1).
4. **At most 10 arguments.** Bundle extras (and any state that must persist
   between calls) into a parameter array.
5. **Target stays Cortex‑M0+** so the blob runs on both chips.

## 1.5 Calling firmware routines (the CallTable)

Because there's no linker, a CSUB reaches the firmware through the **CallTable**.
The easy way is to include the header and call routines by name:

```c
#include "PicoCFunctions.h"
...
*a = FMul(*a, *b);          /* double multiply  */
*a = FAdd(Sine(*a), *b);    /* sin(), add        */
DrawPixel(x, y, RGB_value); /* plot a pixel      */
```

The header locates the CallTable **automatically at runtime** (via the
Cortex‑M `VTOR` register), so there is **no CallTable argument to pass** and the
**same blob runs on every variant and both chips**. Compile with `-I` pointing at
the firmware tree so the header is found (Part 2).

The routines you will use most:

| Call | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `FAdd(a,b)` `FSub(a,b)` `FMul(a,b)` `FDiv(a,b)` | `double` + − × ÷ |
| `Sine(x)` `Cosine(x)` `Sqrt(x)` `Atan2(y,x)` `Power(b,e)` | `double` maths |
| `IntToFloat(i)` `FloatToInt(f)` | convert (FloatToInt rounds) |
| `LMul(a,b)` `LDiv(a,b)` `LMod(a,b)` | `long long` × ÷ remainder |
| `LShl(a,n)` `LAsr(a,n)` `LLsr(a,n)` | `long long` shifts by a variable count |
| `DrawPixel(x,y,c)` | plot one pixel (c is a full RGB colour) |
| `Display_Refresh()` | push direct drawing to a buffered panel |
| `HRes` `VRes` | current screen size |

`DrawPixel` is **format‑ and version‑independent**: you pass a full RGB colour and
the firmware packs it for whatever mode is active — so it is the safe way to plot.
The full list is in Appendix A.

There is also a **single‑precision (`float`) set** — `SAdd`/`SSub`/`SMul`/`SDiv`,
`SSin`/`SCos`/`SSqrt`/`SAtan2`/`SPow`, and the conversions `DtoS`/`StoD`/`StoI`/
`ItoS`. On the RP2350 these run on the M33 FPU and are much faster than the
`double` routines, so they're worth it in hot maths (see Appendix A and
`bubble_s.c`). Inputs from BASIC are `double`, so `DtoS` them to `float` first.

> **Hot loops:** each header wrapper re‑reads the table base. In a tight loop
> cache it once — `unsigned int base = BaseAddress;` then use `(base + 0x90)` —
> or, for maximum speed, write directly into the framebuffer via `WriteBuf`
> (Appendix A; note its bytes are mode‑specific).

## 1.6 Worked examples

### A. Square an integer — no firmware calls, no header

Pure integer work reaches nothing in the firmware, so no header is needed.

```c
long long sqr(long long *a)
{
    int v = (int)(*a);          /* 32-bit multiply, avoids __aeabi_lmul */
    *a = (long long)(v * v);
    return 0;
}
```
```
python armcfgen.py sqr.c --compile -n sqr -e sqr
```
```basic
x% = 5 : sqr x% : Print x%      ' 25
```

### B. Square a double — header + FMul (merge)

```c
#include "PicoCFunctions.h"
long long sqrf(double *a)
{
    *a = FMul(*a, *a);
    return 0;
}
```
```
python armcfgen.py sqrf.c --compile -n sqrf -e sqrf -I d:\Dropbox\PicoMite\PicoMite
```
```basic
x! = 1.5 : sqrf x! : Print x!   ' 2.25
```

### C. Uppercase a string (merge)

The §1.3.3 `supper` example (no header — pure byte work). Build it and call it:

```
python armcfgen.py supper.c --compile -n supper -e supper
```
```basic
a$ = "hello" : supper a$ : Print a$     ' HELLO
```

### D. Several functions, one calling another (merge)

*Merge* mode puts every function in **one** CSUB so they can call each other:

```c
__attribute__((noinline)) static int triple(int x){ return x + x + x; }
long long scale3(long long *a){ *a = (long long)triple((int)*a); return 0; }
```
```
python armcfgen.py scale3.c --compile -n scale3 -e scale3
```

`scale3` calls `triple`; both end up in a single CSUB block with the call between
them resolved. The entry function (`-e scale3`) goes first.

### E. A file of independent CSUBs (join)

*Join* mode emits a **separate** `CSUB … END CSUB` for each function — handy when
you keep a library of unrelated CSUBs in one `.c`:

```c
long long sqr(long long *a){ int v=(int)*a; *a=(long long)(v*v); return 0; }
long long neg(long long *a){ *a = -*a; return 0; }
```
```
python armcfgen.py lib.c --compile -m join
```

This produces a `CSUB sqr …` block and a `CSUB neg …` block, ready to paste
individually. Functions in join mode **cannot** call each other (each is its own
standalone blob).

### F. Constant data — `.rodata` (merge)

`const` data just works; the tool builds it position‑independent:

```c
#include "PicoCFunctions.h"
const char test[] = "12345678";
void main(void)
{
    MMPrintString((char *)test);
}
```

```
python armcfgen.py rotest.c --compile -n rotest -e main -I d:\Dropbox\PicoMite\PicoMite
```
```basic
rotest          ' prints 12345678
```

The `"12345678"` string is appended to the blob and reached PC‑relative, so it
prints correctly wherever the CSUB lands in flash. Note `main` may be `void` —
the C return value is ignored either way.

---

# Part 2 — Building a CSUB with armcfgen.py

`armcfgen.py` turns compiled ARM code into the `CSUB … END CSUB` text. It can
drive the compiler for you, so you go straight from `.c` to a pasteable block.

## 2.1 Prerequisites

* **Python 3.8+** — `python --version`
* **pyelftools** — `pip install pyelftools`
* **Arm GNU toolchain** (`arm-none-eabi-gcc`) on your `PATH` — the same one that
  builds the firmware. On Windows it is typically at
  `C:\Program Files (x86)\Arm GNU Toolchain arm-none-eabi\<version>\bin`.
* The **header** `PicoCFunctions.h` if your source `#include`s it. It ships in
  the firmware tree; point at it with `-I` rather than copying it.

(Only `--compile` and the link step use the toolchain; an already‑linked `.elf`
needs just Python + pyelftools.)

## 2.2 Quick start

```
python armcfgen.py sqrf.c --compile -n sqrf -e sqrf -I d:\Dropbox\PicoMite\PicoMite
```

Add `-o sqrf.bas` to write to a file instead of the screen, then copy the
`CSUB … END CSUB` block into your program.

## 2.3 Command‑line reference

```
python armcfgen.py INPUT [INPUT ...] [options]
```

| Option | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `INPUT` | — | A linked `.elf`, a relocatable `.o`, or `.c` source (with `--compile`). Several inputs are linked together. |
| `-c`, `--compile` | off | Compile the inputs as C first, with the built‑in flags. |
| `-I`, `--include DIR` | — | Header search directory for `--compile` (the firmware tree, for `PicoCFunctions.h`). Repeatable. |
| `-m`, `--mode {join,merge}` | `merge` | Output style — §2.4. |
| `-e`, `--entry NAME` | `main` | Entry symbol: sets the offset word in merge; dropped as a dummy in join. |
| `-n`, `--name NAME` | input stem, upper‑cased | CSUB name in merge mode. |
| `-O`, `--opt LEVEL` | `0` | Optimisation level for `--compile`. `0` is the simple, reliable default; use `s` (or `2`) for compute‑heavy CSUBs. |
| `-o`, `--output FILE` | stdout | Write to a file. |

Built‑in compile flags: `-mcpu=cortex-m0plus -mthumb -O0 -ffreestanding
-fno-exceptions -fpie -mpic-data-is-text-relative -msingle-pic-base`. The
text‑relative PIC flags are what make the blob self‑contained (rodata reached
PC‑relative, resolved at link — no GOT, no firmware fixup). The list of functions
found is printed to stderr.

## 2.4 join vs merge

**merge** (default) — one CSUB containing every function in address order, with
the entry‑offset word pointing at `--entry`. Functions can call each other. Use
for any single‑function CSUB and for multi‑function drivers.

```
python armcfgen.py driver.c helpers.c --compile -n driver -e main -I d:\Dropbox\PicoMite\PicoMite
```

The entry function must be **4‑byte aligned** — make it the first function (the
offset word is word‑granular; the tool errors if the entry lands mid‑word).

**join** — a separate `CSUB name … END CSUB` per function, each with its own
`00000000` offset; the entry symbol is dropped. Functions cannot call each other,
and constant data is rejected.

```
python armcfgen.py lib.elf -m join
```

## 2.5 Automatic linking

If you pass more than one object, or any input is a relocatable `.o`,
`armcfgen.py` links them into one resolved image (gathering `.text.startup`,
`.text*` and `.rodata*` into a single `.text` at address 0). This is what makes
**merge with internal calls** work: an un‑linked `.o` still has the calls between
functions stored as unresolved relocations, and GCC puts `main` in a separate
`.text.startup` section. Linking fixes the calls and merges the fragments. A
fully linked `.elf` is used as‑is.

## 2.6 Output, and the type list you must add

```
CSUB sqrf FLOAT
  00000000
  B5704B08 0004681B 68006841 ...
END CSUB
```

* line 1 — `CSUB`, the name, and the **argument type list you add yourself**
  (the tool only knows the name). Types are `INTEGER`, `FLOAT`, `STRING`; arrays
  are written `INTEGER`, `FLOAT`, `STRING` too and passed as `name()`.
* line 2 — the entry‑offset word (`00000000` = entry at the first code word).
* then the machine code as little‑endian 32‑bit words, eight per line.

Match the type list to your call, e.g. a CSUB taking `(double*, long long*)` is
declared `CSUB myfunc FLOAT, INTEGER`.

## 2.7 Using it in BASIC

Paste the block anywhere (conventionally at the end, like a SUB) and call it:

```basic
Dim Float x! = 3
sqrf x!
Print x!          ' 9
```

No CallTable argument is needed — the blob finds the CallTable itself.

## 2.8 Troubleshooting

| Message | Cause / fix |
|---|---|
| `arm-none-eabi-gcc: not found` | Toolchain not on `PATH` (§2.1). |
| `No module named 'elftools'` | `pip install pyelftools`. |
| `PicoCFunctions.h: No such file` | Add `-I` pointing at the firmware tree. |
| `… is not fully linked. Re-run with --compile…` | An un‑linked `.o` with unresolved relocations — use `--compile` or a linked `.elf`. |
| `undefined reference to '__aeabi_…'` | A `double`/64‑bit operator slipped in — route the maths through the CallTable (§1.4). |
| `undefined reference to '__gnu_thumb1_case_…'` | A jump table got in (an object built without the tool's flags) — compile with `--compile`, or add `-fno-jump-tables` to your own build. |
| `entry '…' is not 4-byte aligned` | Put the merge entry function first in the source. |
| `constant data (.rodata) not allowed in JOIN mode` | Remove `const` tables / big literals, or use merge. |
| `no symbol table` | The object was stripped — rebuild without stripping. |

# Appendix A — The CallTable

Every routine and data pointer a CSUB can reach, with its slot offset from the
table base. With `PicoCFunctions.h` you use the name directly; the offset matters
only if you resolve the table by hand. **Slots are append‑only** — a given offset
always means the same thing across firmware versions, so a compiled CSUB keeps
working.

### Console, formatting and program control

| Name | Offset | Prototype / use |
|---|---|---|
| `uSec` | 0x00 | `void uSec(unsigned long long us)` — busy‑wait microseconds |
| `putConsole` | 0x04 | `void putConsole(int ch, int flush)` — write a character to the console |
| `getConsole` | 0x08 | `int getConsole(void)` — read a character, −1 if none waiting |
| `MMPrintString` | 0x20 | `void MMPrintString(char *s)` — print a null‑terminated C string |
| `IntToStr` | 0x24 | `void IntToStr(char *dst, long long n, unsigned int base)` |
| `FloatToStr` | 0x70 | `void FloatToStr(char *dst, MMFLOAT f, int intDig, int decDig, char pad)` |
| `CheckAbort` | 0x28 | `void CheckAbort(void)` — service the interpreter; honours Ctrl‑C |
| `error` | 0x58 | `void error(char *msg)` — abort the CSUB with a BASIC error (C string) |
| `SoftReset` | 0x54 | `void SoftReset(void)` — restart the firmware |
| `RunBasicSub` | 0x74 | `void RunBasicSub(char *name)` — call a BASIC SUB (name ends in **two** nulls) |

### Pins and PIO

| Name | Offset | Prototype / use |
|---|---|---|
| `ExtCfg` | 0x0C | `void ExtCfg(int pin, int cfg, int option)` — configure a pin (`EXT_DIG_IN`, …) |
| `ExtSet` | 0x10 | `void ExtSet(int pin, int val)` — drive a digital output |
| `ExtInp` | 0x14 | `int ExtInp(int pin)` — read a configured pin |
| `PinSetBit` | 0x18 | `void PinSetBit(int pin, unsigned int offset)` — low‑level pin register write |
| `PinRead` | 0x1C | `int PinRead(int pin)` — read a pin level |
| `ExtCurrentConfig` | 0x48 | `int ExtCurrentConfig[]` — current configuration of each pin |
| `PIOExecute` | 0xD8 | `void PIOExecute(int pio, int sm, uint32_t instruction)` |

### Memory

| Name | Offset | Prototype / use |

### Single precision (float)

`MMFLOAT` is a `double`; these routines operate on C `float`. On the **RP2350**
(firmware built `pico_vfp`) `float` runs on the M33 **FPU**, so single precision
is markedly faster than double — worth using in hot CSUB maths. BASIC numbers are
still `double`, so convert at the boundary: `DtoS` the incoming `pf()` values to
`float`, compute in `float`, then `StoD`/`StoI` to write results back (see
`bubble_s.c`).

### MMBasic strings

Added in 6.03.02b9. An MMBasic string is a **length byte followed by the
data**: `s[0]` is the length and `s+1` the first character, so it is not a C
string and `strlen`/`strcpy` do not apply to it.

`MtoC` and `CtoM` convert in place, between that form and a NUL-terminated C
string, and each returns its argument.

| Name | Offset | Prototype / use |
|---|---|---|
| `MtoC` | 0x164 | `unsigned char *MtoC(unsigned char *s)` — MMBasic form to C string, in place |
| `CtoM` | 0x168 | `unsigned char *CtoM(unsigned char *s)` — C string to MMBasic form, in place |
| `Mstrcpy` | 0x16C | `void Mstrcpy(unsigned char *dst, unsigned char *src)` |
| `Mstrcat` | 0x170 | `void Mstrcat(unsigned char *dst, const unsigned char *src)` |
| `Mstrcmp` | 0x174 | `int Mstrcmp(const unsigned char *, const unsigned char *)` |

These are the interpreter's **own** implementations of the string functions,
so a CSUB and BASIC cannot disagree about what `MID$` means. Each takes the
destination as its first argument and returns it; `GetTempStrMemory` (0x30)
gives you a buffer of the right size.

They never call `error()`, because `error()` does a `longjmp` that would
abandon your CSUB's stack frame. **They clamp instead**: an out-of-range
`start` or `count` is silently brought into range rather than reported. Check
the arguments yourself if you need MMBasic's error.

| `StrCase` | 0x180 | `unsigned char *StrCase(unsigned char *dst, const unsigned char *s, int upper)` — `UCASE$` when upper, `LCASE$` when 0 |
| `StrMid` | 0x184 | `unsigned char *StrMid(unsigned char *dst, const unsigned char *s, int spos, int nbr)` — `MID$`, spos is 1-based |

| `StrFill` | 0x18C | `unsigned char *StrFill(unsigned char *dst, int ch, int n)` — `SPACE$` (ch=' ') and `STRING$` |
| `StrInstr` | 0x190 | `int StrInstr(const unsigned char *s1, const unsigned char *s2, int start)` — `INSTR`, 1-based, 0 if not found |
| `StrFormat` | 0x194 | `unsigned char *StrFormat(unsigned char *dst, MMFLOAT f, long long i64, int isint, int m, int n, int ch)` — `STR$`; pass `isint` to choose which of `f`/`i64` is read, and `STR_AUTO_PRECISION` for n to get BASIC's default |
| `StrVal` | 0x1A8 | `int StrVal(const unsigned char *p, MMFLOAT *f, long long *i)` — `VAL`, on a **C** string; returns non-zero if the result is an integer |
