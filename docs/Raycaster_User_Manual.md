# PicoMite Raycaster User Manual

## Overview

The RAY command set provides a Wolfenstein 3D-style first-person renderer for the PicoMite MMBasic on RP2350. It renders textured walls, patterned floors and ceilings, full-colour billboard sprites, and includes built-in collision detection, ray casting for interaction, and a minimap overlay.

The raycaster renders directly into the current framebuffer at whatever resolution is set by the active MODE command. It reads the system `HRes` and `VRes` at render time, so it is not limited to a single resolution. Mode 2 (320×240, 4-bit RGB121 colour) is recommended for best performance. The user is responsible for creating the framebuffer and copying it to the display.

**Platform:** RP2350 only (PicoMite, PicoMiteVGA, HDMI).

## Commands

### RAY MAP w, h, map%()

Define the world grid using an integer array.

| Parameter | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `w` | Map width in cells (1–256) |
| `h` | Map height in cells (1–256) |
| `map%()` | 1D integer array with `w × h` entries |

Each array element is a wall type:
- **0** = empty (passable space)
- **1–31** = wall (rendered using the wall definition assigned by `RAY DEFINE`)

Every wall type from 1 to 31 has its own foreground colour, background colour, fill pattern, and an optional door flag. See `RAY DEFINE` to customise these. The defaults give types 1–15 green shades and types 16–31 brown/yellow shades with the door flag set.

The array is stored row by row: element `y * w + x` corresponds to map cell (x, y).

> **Note:** Each integer element uses 8 bytes of RAM. For large maps, consider the string array form below.

---

### RAY MAP w, h, map$()

Define the world grid using a string array (memory-efficient form).

| Parameter | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `w` | Map width in cells (1–256) |
| `h` | Map height in cells (1–256) |
| `map$()` | 1D string array with at least `h` elements, each string at least `w` characters |

Each character in the string represents one map cell:
- **`'0'`** = empty (passable space)
- **`'1'`–`'9'`** = wall types 1–9
- **`'A'`–`'Z'`** (or `'a'`–`'z'`) = wall types 10–35

This form uses **1 byte per cell** for both the program definition and variable storage, compared to 8 bytes per cell for the integer array form. For a 57×51 map this saves over 20 KB of RAM.

**Example:**
```basic
' A 4x4 map using string array
DIM m$(3) LENGTH 4
m$(0) = "1111"
m$(1) = "1001"
m$(2) = "1001"
m$(3) = "1111"
RAY MAP 4, 4, m$()
```

Row 0 of the map comes from `m$(0)`, row 1 from `m$(1)`, etc. The leftmost character is column 0 (x = 0).

---

### RAY CAMERA x!, y!, angle! [, fov!]

Place and orient the viewer camera.

| Parameter | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `x!`, `y!` | Position in map space (floating-point, 0-based) |
| `angle!` | Heading in degrees (0 = +X/east, 90 = +Y/south) |
| `fov!` | Field of view in degrees (default 60, range 10–170) |

> **Tip:** Position the camera at `x + 0.5, y + 0.5` to centre it within a map cell.

---

### RAY COLOUR floor_fg, ceil_fg [, floor_bg, ceil_bg, floor_pat, ceil_pat]

Set the floor and ceiling appearance.

**2-argument form** — solid colours:

| Parameter | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `floor_fg` | Floor colour (RGB121 palette index 0–15) |
| `ceil_fg` | Ceiling colour (RGB121 palette index 0–15) |

**6-argument form** — textured with fill patterns:

| Parameter | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `floor_fg` | Floor foreground colour (0–15) |
| `ceil_fg` | Ceiling foreground colour (0–15) |
| `floor_bg` | Floor background colour (0–15) |
| `ceil_bg` | Ceiling background colour (0–15) |
| `floor_pat` | Floor fill pattern index (0–31) |
| `ceil_pat` | Ceiling fill pattern index (0–31) |

Pattern bits set to 1 draw in the foreground colour; bits set to 0 draw in the background colour.

> **Note:** `RAY COLOR` is accepted as an alternative spelling.

---

### RAY MOVE speed! [, strafe!]

Move the camera with built-in collision detection.

| Parameter | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `speed!` | Forward speed (positive = forward, negative = backward) |
| `strafe!` | Optional. Sideways speed (positive = right, negative = left) |

The engine uses a 0.25-unit bounding box around the camera. If the full move is blocked by a wall, it attempts **wall sliding**: first X-only movement, then Y-only. If completely blocked, the camera stays put.

---

### RAY TURN degrees!

Rotate the camera heading.

| Parameter | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `degrees!` | Rotation amount (positive = clockwise/right, negative = left) |

The heading is automatically normalised to 0–360°.

---

### RAY CELL x, y, value

Write a value to a map cell at runtime.

| Parameter | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `x` | Cell X coordinate (0 to map width − 1) |
| `y` | Cell Y coordinate (0 to map height − 1) |
| `value` | Wall type: integer 0–31, or single character `"0"`–`"9"`, `"A"`–`"Z"` (0 = empty) |

Use this for doors, destructible walls, switches, or any dynamic map modification.

---

### RAY CAST angle!

Cast a single ray from the camera position at an absolute angle.

| Parameter | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `angle!` | Absolute angle in degrees |

Results are stored internally and retrieved with `RAY(CASTDIST)`, `RAY(CASTWALL)`, `RAY(CASTSIDE)`, `RAY(CASTX)`, `RAY(CASTY)`.

Useful for "use" buttons, shooting mechanics, proximity checks, or finding what the player is looking at.

---

### RAY SPRITE id, spritenum, x!, y!

Place or update a billboard sprite in the world.

| Parameter | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `id` | Raycaster sprite slot (0–31) |
| `spritenum` | SPRITE buffer number (1–64), loaded via `SPRITE LOAD` or `SPRITE LOADARRAY` |
| `x!`, `y!` | World-space position (floating-point) |

The sprite's full-colour 4bpp image is read from the sprite buffer and rendered as a billboard (always facing the camera). Pixels matching the current `SPRITE SET TRANSPARENT` colour are not drawn. Sprites are automatically depth-sorted and clipped against the wall z-buffer.

> **Note:** The sprite buffer must be loaded before calling RAY SPRITE. Use `SPRITE LOADARRAY` to create sprites from BASIC arrays, or `SPRITE LOAD` to load `.spr` files.

### RAY SPRITE REMOVE id

Remove sprite `id` from the raycaster (stop rendering it).

### RAY SPRITE CLEAR

Remove all sprites.

---

### RAY MINIMAP x, y, size

Draw a top-down minimap overlay onto the framebuffer.

| Parameter | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `x` | Screen X position of the minimap |
| `y` | Screen Y position of the minimap |
| `size` | Size in pixels (longest map axis fits within this) |

The minimap scales the entire map to fit, preserving aspect ratio. Each wall cell is drawn in that wall definition's foreground colour. Door cells show their definition's foreground colour when closed, yellow when partially open, and black when fully open. Empty space is black, the player is a white dot with a direction indicator, and sprites are yellow dots. A dark green border is drawn around the edge.

Call after `RAY RENDER` and before `FRAMEBUFFER COPY`.

---

### RAY DOOR x, y, offset!

Set a sliding door at a map cell with a given open offset.

| Parameter | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `x` | Cell X coordinate (0 to map width − 1) |
| `y` | Cell Y coordinate (0 to map height − 1) |
| `offset!` | Door offset: 0.0 = fully closed, 1.0 = fully open |

The map cell at (x, y) must contain a wall type whose definition has the door flag set (see `RAY DEFINE`). When `offset` is between 0 and 1, the door is partially open — rays pass through the open portion and hit the remaining solid portion. When `offset` reaches 1.0, the cell becomes fully passable for both rays and movement.

Up to 8 doors may be active simultaneously. To animate a door, call `RAY DOOR` each frame with an incrementally increasing or decreasing offset.

### RAY DOOR CLOSE x, y

Remove the door slot at (x, y). The cell reverts to a normal solid wall (as if `RAY DOOR` was never called). Call this after closing animation completes (offset reaches 0.0).

### RAY DOOR CLEAR

Remove all active door slots.

---

### RAY DEFINE type, fg, bg, pattern [, door]

Set the visual properties for a wall type.

| Parameter | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `type` | Wall type to define: integer 1–31, or single character `"1"`–`"9"`, `"A"`–`"Z"` (10–35) |
| `fg` | Foreground colour (RGB121 palette index 0–15) |
| `bg` | Background colour (RGB121 palette index 0–15) |
| `pattern` | Fill pattern index (0–31) |
| `door` | Optional. 1 = this type acts as a door, 0 = normal wall (default 0) |

Every wall type from 1 to 31 has a definition that controls its rendered appearance. The definition is used for both X-side and Y-side hits; Y-side hits are automatically dimmed by the engine for depth cueing.

Definitions persist until `RAY CLOSE`. Call `RAY DEFINE` after `RAY MAP` but before `RAY RENDER`.

**Defaults** (set by `RAY MAP`):

| Types | fg | bg | pattern | door |
|-------|----|----|---------|------|
| 1–15 | GREEN (6) | MIDGREEN (4) | type − 1 | 0 |
| 16–31 | YELLOW (14) | BROWN (12) | type − 1 | 1 |

**Example — red brick walls for type 1:**

```basic
RAY DEFINE 1, 8, 10, 3       ' fg=RED, bg=RUST, pattern 3
```

**Example — custom blue door:**

```basic
RAY DEFINE 7, 1, 3, 6, 1     ' fg=BLUE, bg=COBALT, pattern 6, door=1
RAY CELL door_x, door_y, 7
```

---

### RAY RENDER

Render the complete 3D scene into the current `WriteBuf` framebuffer. This draws:

1. Textured floor and ceiling (horizontal scanlines)
2. Textured walls (vertical columns via DDA raycasting)
3. Billboard sprites (depth-sorted, z-buffered)

A framebuffer must be active (`FRAMEBUFFER CREATE` / `FRAMEBUFFER WRITE F`).

---

### RAY CLOSE

Free all raycaster state (map, column arrays, sprites). Called automatically on program end.

---

## RGB121 Colour Palette

The 4-bit RGB121 palette provides 16 colours. Each index encodes 1 bit red, 2 bits green, 1 bit blue.

| Index | Name | RGB888 | Appearance |
|-------|------|--------|------------|
| 0 | BLACK | 000000 | Black |
| 1 | BLUE | 0000FF | Blue |
| 2 | MYRTLE | 004000 | Dark green |
| 3 | COBALT | 0040FF | Dark cyan-blue |
| 4 | MIDGREEN | 008000 | Medium green |
| 5 | CERULEAN | 0080FF | Sky blue |
| 6 | GREEN | 00FF00 | Bright green |
| 7 | CYAN | 00FFFF | Cyan |
| 8 | RED | FF0000 | Red |
| 9 | MAGENTA | FF00FF | Magenta |
| 10 | RUST | FF4000 | Dark orange |
| 11 | FUCHSIA | FF40FF | Pink |
| 12 | BROWN | FF8000 | Brown/orange |
| 13 | LILAC | FF80FF | Light pink |
| 14 | YELLOW | FFFF00 | Yellow |
| 15 | WHITE | FFFFFF | White |

### Wall Definitions

Every wall type from 1 to 31 has a fully customisable **wall definition** comprising a foreground colour, background colour, fill pattern, and a door flag. Use `RAY DEFINE` to set these; the defaults are:

| Types | Foreground | Background | Pattern | Door |
|-------|-----------|-----------|---------|------|
| 1–15 | GREEN (6) | MIDGREEN (4) | type − 1 | 0 (no) |
| 16–31 | YELLOW (14) | BROWN (12) | type − 1 | 1 (yes) |

**Y-side depth cueing:** When a wall column is an Y-side hit, the foreground and background colours are automatically dimmed by decrementing the green channel of the RGB121 value (e.g., GREEN 6 → MIDGREEN 4, YELLOW 14 → BROWN 12). This gives walls a bright/dark shade difference that conveys depth without requiring a separate colour definition per side.

---

## Fill Patterns

Wall and floor/ceiling textures use the Turtle graphics fill patterns (indices 0–31). Each pattern is an 8×8 grid of 1-bit pixels. During rendering, pattern bit 1 selects the foreground colour and bit 0 selects the background colour.

Each wall definition specifies a pattern index (0–31) via `RAY DEFINE`. By default, `pattern = wall_type - 1`, giving each wall type a unique texture. Patterns are tiled twice per map cell for increased texture density.

---

## Sprite System

Raycaster sprites use the standard PicoMite SPRITE system for image data. Sprites are loaded into sprite buffers (1–64) using `SPRITE LOAD` or `SPRITE LOADARRAY`, then placed into the raycaster world using `RAY SPRITE`.

### Loading Sprites from Arrays

```basic
' Define a 16-colour 8x8 sprite using RGB888 colour values
DIM INTEGER pixels%(63)
' ... fill pixels% with RGB888 colours ...
SPRITE LOADARRAY buffer_num, width, height, pixels%()
```

Each pixel is an RGB888 value (e.g., `&hFF0000` for red). The system automatically converts to the 4-bit RGB121 palette. Pixels are packed two per byte (even pixel in low nibble, odd pixel in high nibble).

### Transparency

Set the transparent colour index with:

```basic
SPRITE SET TRANSPARENT colour_index
```

Default is 0 (BLACK). Any sprite pixel matching this index is not drawn, allowing the wall/floor behind to show through.

### Sprite Rendering

During `RAY RENDER`, sprites are:
1. Sorted by distance from camera (furthest first — painter's algorithm)
2. Projected onto the screen as billboards (always face the camera)
3. Scaled based on distance, preserving the sprite's aspect ratio
4. Clipped per-column against the wall z-buffer (walls occlude sprites)
5. Drawn pixel-by-pixel, skipping transparent pixels

Up to 32 raycaster sprites can be active simultaneously, referencing up to 64 sprite buffers.

---

## Implementing Doors

Doors use the `RAY DOOR` command for smooth sliding animation. Any wall type can act as a door if its definition has the door flag set (`RAY DEFINE type, fg, bg, pattern, 1`). By default, types 16–31 have the door flag.

### Basic Door Setup

```basic
' Place a door wall (type 31 has door flag set by default)
RAY CELL door_x, door_y, 31

' Or define a custom door type (e.g. red/rust with pattern 7)
RAY DEFINE 5, 8, 10, 7, 1
RAY CELL door_x, door_y, 5
```

### Animated Opening

```basic
' Start opening: create a door slot and animate over multiple frames
door_offset! = 0.0
DO WHILE door_offset! < 1.0
  door_offset! = door_offset! + 0.1
  IF door_offset! > 1.0 THEN door_offset! = 1.0
  RAY DOOR door_x, door_y, door_offset!
  RAY RENDER
  FRAMEBUFFER COPY F, N
  PAUSE 50
LOOP
' Door is now fully open — player can walk through
```

### Animated Closing

```basic
' Close: animate offset back to 0, then release the slot
DO WHILE door_offset! > 0.0
  door_offset! = door_offset! - 0.1
  IF door_offset! < 0.0 THEN door_offset! = 0.0
  RAY DOOR door_x, door_y, door_offset!
  RAY RENDER
  FRAMEBUFFER COPY F, N
  PAUSE 50
LOOP
RAY DOOR CLOSE door_x, door_y
' Door is fully closed and slot is released
```

### How It Works

When `RAY DOOR` sets an offset between 0 and 1, the door slides open from one side. Rays that hit the open portion pass through to the corridor behind; rays that hit the remaining solid portion render the door texture. The door blocks movement until `offset` reaches 1.0, at which point the cell becomes fully passable.

The minimap shows door state: brown when closed, yellow when partially open, empty when fully open.

---

## Coordinate System

- **Map coordinates** are 0-based. Cell (0,0) is the top-left corner.
- **X axis** increases to the right (east).
- **Y axis** increases downward (south).
- **Angle 0°** points in the +X direction (east). Angles increase clockwise: 90° = south, 180° = west, 270° = north.
- Camera and sprite positions use floating-point coordinates. A position of (2.5, 3.5) is the centre of cell (2, 3).

---

## Typical Game Loop

```basic
MODE 2
CLS
' ... define map string or integer array ...
FRAMEBUFFER CREATE
FRAMEBUFFER WRITE F

RAY MAP w, h, map$()    ' or: RAY MAP w, h, map%()
RAY CAMERA start_x, start_y, start_angle, 66
RAY COLOUR floor_fg, ceil_fg, floor_bg, ceil_bg, floor_pat, ceil_pat

' ... load sprites, place them ...

DO
  k$ = INKEY$
  IF k$ = CHR$(27) THEN EXIT DO
  
  ' Movement
  IF k$ = "w" THEN RAY MOVE 0.15
  IF k$ = "s" THEN RAY MOVE -0.15
  IF k$ = "a" THEN RAY TURN -5
  IF k$ = "d" THEN RAY TURN 5
  
  ' Interaction
  IF k$ = " " THEN
    RAY CAST RAY(CAMA)
    IF RAY(CASTDIST) < 2.0 THEN
      ' ... handle what was hit ...
    ENDIF
  ENDIF
  
  ' Render
  RAY RENDER
  RAY MINIMAP 2, 2, 48
  FRAMEBUFFER COPY F, N
LOOP

RAY CLOSE
FRAMEBUFFER CLOSE
```

---

## Limitations

- **RP2350 only** — not available on RP2040 builds.
- **Maximum map size:** 256 × 256 cells.
- **Maximum raycaster sprites:** 32 active at once.
- **Maximum active doors:** 8 simultaneously.
- **Maximum sprite buffers:** 64 (shared with the standard SPRITE system).
- **Wall types:** 1–31 only (capped at the number of Turtle fill patterns).
- **Colour depth:** 4-bit RGB121 (16 colours). All 16 colours are available for walls (via `RAY DEFINE`), floor, ceiling, and sprites.
- **Resolution:** Uses the current `HRes` and `VRes` — works at any resolution. Mode 2 (320×240) is recommended; higher resolutions work but render more slowly.
- **Single height level:** No floor/ceiling height variation (classic Wolfenstein-style).

## Appendix A: Technical Implementation

### Architecture

The raycaster is implemented entirely in C (`Raycaster.c`, ~1350 lines) with a header (`Raycaster.h`). It integrates into the MMBasic command/function dispatch system via `cmd_ray()` and `fun_ray()`, registered in `AllCommands.h`. State cleanup is hooked into `CloseAllFiles()` in `FileIO.c`.

All state is held in a single heap-allocated `RayState` structure, accessed through the static pointer `rstate`. Memory is managed using PicoMite's `GetMemory()`/`FreeMemory()` allocator.

### DDA Algorithm

The wall-casting engine uses the standard **Digital Differential Analyzer (DDA)** algorithm:

1. For each screen column, a ray is cast from the camera position through the corresponding point on the camera plane.
2. The ray steps through the grid one cell boundary at a time, alternating between X-side and Y-side crossings, always choosing the nearer crossing.
3. When the ray enters a cell with a non-zero wall type, the DDA loop terminates.
4. The **perpendicular distance** (not Euclidean) is computed to avoid fisheye distortion: `perp_dist = side_dist - delta_dist` for the last step.
5. The wall strip height is `screen_height / perp_dist`.

The perpendicular distance for each column is stored in `col_dist[]` and reused as the z-buffer for sprite clipping.

### Wall Rendering

Walls are drawn as textured vertical strips using `ray_vline_textured()`. Each wall type selects a Turtle fill pattern (8×8, 1-bit). The texture coordinates are:

- **Horizontal (tex_x):** Derived from the fractional wall-hit position, multiplied by 16 and masked to 0–7. This tiles the 8-texel pattern twice across each wall face.
- **Vertical (tex_y):** Mapped from the screen Y range with a 16× multiplier and `& 7` wrapping, tiling the pattern twice vertically per wall height.

Pattern bits select between a foreground/background colour pair. The side of the wall hit (X-side vs Y-side) determines which pair is used, providing a shading effect that gives depth perception.

Each wall type has a configurable foreground/background colour pair and fill pattern, set via `RAY DEFINE`. Y-side hits are automatically dimmed by decrementing the RGB121 green channel, providing a depth cue without requiring separate per-side colours.

### Door Rendering

Sliding doors are handled within the DDA loop. When a ray enters a cell whose wall definition has the door flag set, the engine checks whether an active door slot exists for that cell:

1. If the door offset is 0.0 (or no slot exists), the cell is treated as a normal solid wall.
2. If the door offset is ≥ 1.0, the cell is fully open — the ray passes through and the DDA continues to the next cell.
3. For intermediate offsets (0.0–1.0), the engine computes the **fractional hit position** on the wall face using the same perpendicular distance formula used for texture coordinates. If the fractional position is less than the door offset, the ray passes through the open portion. Otherwise, the ray hits the remaining solid door.

This creates a sliding-door effect: the opening grows from one side of the wall face as the offset increases. The texture on the remaining visible portion is unchanged — the door appears to slide sideways.

Collision detection also respects door state: cells with a door offset ≥ 1.0 are passable; partially-open doors still block movement.

The minimap shows doors with distinct colours: brown when closed, yellow when partially open, and empty (black) when fully open.

Up to 8 doors can be active simultaneously, stored in fixed-size slots within `RayState`. The `ray_get_door_offset()` helper searches these slots by cell coordinates.

### Floor and Ceiling Rendering

The floor/ceiling renderer uses a **horizontal scanline** approach, which is more efficient than per-pixel ray casting:

1. For each row below the horizon, the **row distance** is calculated: `row_dist = half_screen_height / (row - horizon)`.
2. The world-space floor position at the leftmost and rightmost screen edges is computed using the camera's left and right ray directions.
3. A linear interpolation step is computed per column, and the inner loop advances by addition only (no per-pixel division).
4. Texture coordinates are computed by multiplying the world position by 16 and masking to 0–7, tiling the pattern twice per map cell.
5. The ceiling row is mirrored: `ceil_y = screen_height - 1 - floor_y`.
6. Pixels are written two at a time (even/odd nibble packing) to minimise memory operations.

### Sprite Rendering

Billboard sprites are rendered after walls, using the wall z-buffer for per-column occlusion:

1. Active sprites are collected and sorted by squared distance from the camera (furthest first — painter's algorithm).
2. Each sprite's world position is transformed into camera space using the inverse of the 2×2 camera matrix (direction × plane).
3. The sprite is projected to a screen rectangle based on its distance, with width scaled by the sprite image's aspect ratio.
4. For each visible screen column (not occluded by a closer wall), the sprite's 4bpp pixel data is sampled from the SPRITE buffer.
5. Pixels matching `sprite_transparent` are skipped. Other pixels are written directly into the framebuffer.

The 4bpp pixel format matches the framebuffer layout: even pixels in the low nibble, odd pixels in the high nibble of each byte. The sprite row stride is `(sprite_width + 1) / 2` bytes.

### Collision Detection

`RAY MOVE` implements collision detection with wall sliding:

1. A 0.25-unit radius bounding box is checked at the target position.
2. All four corners of the box are tested against the map grid.
3. If any corner overlaps a wall cell, the full move is blocked.
4. The engine then tries **X-only** movement (slide along Y walls).
5. If that's also blocked, it tries **Y-only** movement (slide along X walls).
6. If completely blocked, the camera doesn't move.

This simple approach provides smooth wall-sliding with no tunnelling at normal movement speeds.

### RAY CAST

`RAY CAST` runs the same DDA algorithm as the main renderer but for a single ray at an arbitrary angle. Results are stored in the `cast_*` fields of the raycaster state and queried via `RAY(CASTDIST)`, `RAY(CASTWALL)`, `RAY(CASTSIDE)`, `RAY(CASTX)`, `RAY(CASTY)`.

### Minimap

The minimap iterates over all map cells, scaling to fit the longest axis within the specified pixel size while preserving the map's aspect ratio. Active sprites are drawn as coloured dots. The player is shown as a white dot with a 2-pixel direction indicator computed from the camera angle.

### Memory Usage

| Item | Size |
|------|------|
| `RayState` structure | ~2.6 KB (including 32 wall definitions, 32 sprites, and 8 doors) |
| Map storage | `w × h` bytes (max 64 KB for 256×256) |
| Column distance array | `HRes × 4` bytes (1280 for 320 cols) |
| Column wall-type array | `HRes` bytes (320) |

Total overhead for a typical 57×51 map at 320×240: approximately **6.5 KB** plus the framebuffer.

### Compilation

The raycaster is compiled with `-Os` (optimise for size) across all RP2350 build variants. It is conditionally included via `#ifdef rp2350` in `AllCommands.h` and `CMakeLists.txt`.

## Appendix B: Demo Program

The following program demonstrates all raycaster features in a continuous automated walkthrough. It defines a 57×51 map, creates five colourful sprites, builds a wall with an animated sliding door, and runs a pre-programmed round-trip sequence that loops indefinitely.

### How the Demo Works

#### Initialisation

The demo starts by setting Mode 2 (320×240 @ 4bpp RGB121), then defines a 57×51 map using a string array. Each string element is one row of the map, with characters `'0'` = empty and `'1'`–`'5'` = wall types (pre-varied using a `(x + y) MOD 5 + 1` pattern so different fill textures appear across the map). This approach uses only 1 byte per cell instead of 8 bytes for the integer array form, saving over 20 KB of RAM for this map.

A framebuffer is created and the raycaster is initialised with `RAY MAP`, `RAY CAMERA`, and `RAY COLOUR` (brown floor pattern 1, cobalt ceiling pattern 3).

The rotation speed is set to exactly 5.625° per step, so that `D16` (16 right-turn steps) makes exactly 90° and four such turns return to the original heading — essential for the seamless loop.

#### Door Construction

Six `RAY CELL` commands build a north-south wall segment at x=30 (rows 19–24). Five cells use wall type 3 (green by default), while the cell at y=23 uses type 31 (brown/yellow with door flag by default). From the starting position, this wall is clearly visible ahead with the door panel standing out.

#### Sprite Creation

Five 8×8 sprites are created procedurally using `SPRITE LOADARRAY`:

| Buffer | Design | Method |
|--------|--------|--------|
| 1 | Red cross | Two-pixel-wide cross at columns 3–4 and rows 3–4 |
| 2 | Yellow diamond | Manhattan distance from centre ≤ 3 |
| 3 | Green/cyan stripes | Alternating columns |
| 4 | Magenta/blue checkerboard | `(x + y) MOD 2` test |
| 5 | White ring | Border pixels and corner diagonals |

The five sprites are placed at known open positions around the door wall.

#### Door Animation System

The demo uses per-frame door animation driven by BASIC variables:

- `door_offset!` — current door position (0.0–1.0)
- `door_target!` — where the door is heading (0.0 or 1.0)
- `door_animating%` — whether animation is active
- `door_step!` — offset change per frame (0.1 = 10 frames to fully open or close)

The `O` command sets `door_target! = 1.0` and starts animating. Each frame, if `door_animating%` is set, the offset moves toward the target by `door_step!`. When the target is reached, animation stops. For closing (`C` command), the same logic runs in reverse; when offset reaches 0.0, `RAY DOOR CLOSE` releases the slot.

#### Sequence Engine

The auto-play system uses a compact string encoding: each command is a single letter followed by a repeat count.

| Letter | Action |
|--------|--------|
| `W` | Walk forward (`RAY MOVE moveSpeed`) |
| `S` | Walk backward (`RAY MOVE -moveSpeed`) |
| `A` | Turn left (`RAY TURN -rotSpeed`) |
| `D` | Turn right (`RAY TURN rotSpeed`) |
| `O` | Start door open animation |
| `C` | Start door close animation |
| `P` | Pause (render without moving) |

The parser reads one letter, then digits for the repeat count (e.g., `W22` = walk forward 22 steps, `D16` = turn right 16 steps = 90°). Each step renders a frame, draws the minimap, adds a crosshair, and copies the framebuffer to screen with a 50ms delay.

#### Tour Sequence (Round Trip)

The sequence `P5W22P3O1P10W15P5D16W5P5W5D16W30D16W5P5W5P5D16W15P3C1P10A16W5P5D32W5D16W22D16D16P5` executes:

**Approach and open door:**

1. **P5** — Pause 5 frames: view the wall with the brown/yellow door panel ahead
2. **W22** — Walk east 4.4 units toward the door
3. **P3** — Pause close to the door wall
4. **O1** — Start door opening animation (door begins sliding)
5. **P10** — Pause 10 frames while door animates from closed to fully open

**Through the door, visit east sprites:**

6. **W15** — Walk east 3.0 units through the open doorway to the red cross sprite
7. **P5** — Pause at sprite 0
8. **D16** — Turn right 90° (face south)
9. **W5** — Walk south 1.0 unit to the yellow diamond sprite
10. **P5** — Pause at sprite 1

**West loop to remaining sprites:**

11. **W5** — Walk south 1.0 unit below the door wall at y=25.5
12. **D16** — Turn right 90° (face west)
13. **W30** — Walk west 6.0 units past the wall
14. **D16** — Turn right 90° (face north)
15. **W5** — Walk north 1.0 unit to the green stripes sprite
16. **P5** — Pause at sprite 2
17. **W5** — Walk north 1.0 unit to the checkerboard sprite
18. **P5** — Pause at sprite 3

**Close door:**

19. **D16** — Turn right 90° (face east)
20. **W15** — Walk east 3.0 units back near the door (from west side)
21. **P3** — Pause, see the open doorway
22. **C1** — Start door closing animation
23. **P10** — Pause 10 frames while door slides shut

**Visit sprite 4 and return:**

24. **A16** — Turn left 90° (face north)
25. **W5** — Walk north 1.0 unit to the white ring sprite
26. **P5** — Pause at sprite 4
27. **D32** — Turn right 180° (face south)
28. **W5** — Walk south 1.0 unit back to y=23.5
29. **D16** — Turn right 90° (face west)
30. **W22** — Walk west 4.4 units back to start X position
31. **D16, D16** — Turn right 180° (face east = start heading)
32. **P5** — Pause at start position

#### Continuous Loop

The entire demo is wrapped in an outer `DO...LOOP`. At the top of each iteration, the camera is reset to the start position (25.5, 23.5) facing east, the door wall is rebuilt via `RAY CELL` commands, door animation state is cleared, and the sequence replays from the beginning. This creates a seamless continuous demonstration. Pressing ESC exits cleanly via `GOTO Done`.
