"""Pre-flight checks for a PicoMite release.

Run from anywhere:  python tools/release_preflight.py
Exits non-zero on the first failure, so it can gate the publish:

    python tools/release_preflight.py && gh release create ...

NEVER gate binary freshness on source-file mtimes in this repo: Dropbox
rewrites mtimes on sync without a byte changing, which condemns good
binaries.  Freshness is measured against COMMIT times (a sync cannot forge
one), with a separate porcelain check to catch sources edited but not yet
committed - which a commit-time check alone would miss.
