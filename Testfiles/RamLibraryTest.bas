' The library goes into RAM slot 5 in PSRAM and shadows the flash library
' until END or the next RUN; the flash library is not touched.  This loads
' Testfiles/ramlib_lib.bas (put it on A:/ first), then checks that its CONST,
' SUB, FUNCTION and CSUB all work from PSRAM, that the slot carries the hash
' tag, and that the slot cannot be taken over while the library is active.
' Run it twice: the second time the load is a re-attach and takes no time.
' Then, at the prompt, RLDouble must be unknown again and RAM LIST must no
' longer say "the RAM library".
